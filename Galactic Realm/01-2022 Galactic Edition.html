	<div class="date" id="art-gallery"><h2>ART GALLERY THEMES</h2><div class="date-info">
		<a href="/art/gallery.phtml">The Art Gallery</a> is one of many contests that the Neopets site has to offer. For this one, you submit some of your own original Neopets fan art. If your image is selected, it will be placed and honored in the Art Gallery! You'll also get a shiny trophy for your user lookup, 10,000 neo and a random rare item!<br><Br>

		<h4>Getting Selected</h4>

		Kikocat selects which works will appear in the competition and it isn't so easy to be selected. When a Neopian holiday is coming up such as Gadgadsbogen, Krawk Day, or Jhudora Day, the Art Gallery is almost always themed around that day, so if one of those are coming up you should submit artwork related to it for a better chance! The same goes for real holidays like Valentines or St. Patrick's.<br><br>

		However, if you do plan to submit your art for a holiday, it's best if you submit it 2 days!! in advance. Often times the Art Gallery sets up its art the day before the actual holiday. Just another reason why it's usually not a good idea to wait till the last minute!<br><Br>

		<div class="date-icon"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/games/aaa/trophies/2009/dd_trophies_1gold.gif"></div><div class="date-info">
		The high score tables reset at around 12:10 AM NST on the 1st of each month; the first day is the easiest to get a trophy, especially in luck/chance games and games with a maximum possible score. Trophies are awarded at 8pm NST each evening. For the best chance at a trophy, send game scores between 12:01am - 7:59pm on the first of the month. 
		<p>A few games, namely Maths Nightmare and Escape from Meridell Castle have avatars associated with them. But these avatars require you to be on the top 50 of the high score list. After scores reset night, the high score list will be at their lowest making it a great opportunity to go for it. You just need to hold your place in the top 50 until 11.50pm.
		This may be a good opportunity to try for other game avatars as then you may also manage a trophy at the same time though it's difficult.</p><a href="/games/" class="send">Games Room</a>

		Half Price Day is the third day of every month. The official Neopets shops price their stock at half-price, and you can haggle down further from there. Speed is of the essence on this day-- even more restockers than usual will flock to the shops to get a better price for the items and will be snapping things up faster than the younger players who tend to hobble into the shops at any ol' time. Kauvara's Magic Shop and the Post Office tend to be the most competitive.<br><br>

		The <a href="#hidden-tower">Hidden Tower</a> does not reduce its prices on half price day but is affected by a similar event.<br><br> You can use this shop directory (http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=shopsdirectory) to locate the best deals during Half Price day!

This makes a big difference though when buying those really expensive items, with prices reaching in the hundred thousands or even millions of Neo! If you're planning on buying from the HT, it is suggested that you wait until that day to avoid overpaying.

		The <a href="/prehistoric/battleground/">Tyrannian Battleground</a> is an ongoing feature in the Battledome where you get to choose a faction to join and fight for every two weeks. At the end of each two week cycle, the Oracle awards prizes to the winning faction.<br><br><i>The Battleground is a follow-up from the War for the Obelisk event (https://www.jellyneo.net/?go=tyrannia_plot), in which six factions fought over a magical obelisk that appeared in Neopia.</i>
		<h4>Sign Ups</h4>
		Every other Monday, head on over to the <a href="/prehistoric/battleground/">battleground</a> to enlist yourself among the brave warriors. You have three days to sign up with your faction of choice. Each cycle, three random factions will be selected to participate in that week's battle. The prizes you receive (see the Boons section below) differ depending on your faction, so it can be more advantageous to join in depending on the available factions.

		<h4>Battling</h4>
		The fighting kicks off on the Thursday following sign ups and continues for four days. Your faction leader will help you keep track of your battles during each skirmish. In order to qualify as having helped your faction, you have to take part in at least 10 battles, regardless of difficulty. It is unknown at this time how the difficulty of the challengers affects the number of points your team receives. You can find a list of all the challengers in the JellyNeo In-Depth Battlepedia (http://battlepedia.jellyneo.net/?go=challengers&category=33).

		<h4>Prizes: Boons</h4>
		If you allied yourself with the victorious faction during a skirmish, then you will be rewarded with your choice of boon (a fancy name for "perks") to enhance the site for the duration of the week-long truce. Each faction has its own list of priorities, so not all boons are available for every faction.<br><br><b>FULL GUIDE  | https://www.jellyneo.net/?go=battleground_of_the_obelisk</b>

			</li></ul></div>

					
			<h3>Instructions</h3>
					
			<b>Make the Salsa Roja:</b><ul><li>
					
			Roughly cut the yellow onion_  core and quarter the tomatoes, remove the seeds and membrane from the jalapeno, and peel the garlic cloves. Toss all ingredients into a blender or food processor and blend until completely smooth. Add the chicken broth and blend well. </li><li>
					
			Heat the oil in a large sk1llet over medium heat. Add the blended mixture and cook over medium-low heat until thickened (about 15-20 minutes). </li><li>
					
			While the salsa simmers, prepare the tortilla chips. </li></ul>
					
			<b>Make the Tortilla Chips:</b><ul><li>
					
			Heat the oil in a deep fryer. Cut the tortillas into 6 pieces.  </li><li>
					
			Working in batches, deep fry the tortillas for about 1 minute, or until they start to brown on the edges. Be sure to shake the basket to prevent the chips from sticking to each other. Remove the chips to a paper-towel lined plate and sprinkle with salt. </li></ul><b>
					
			Make Fried Eggs and Assemble Chilaquiles:</b><ul><li>
					
			In a small, nonstick sauté pan, melt the butter. Carefully c.rack eggs into the pan and let fry for 1-2 minutes. If you're brave, or if you prefer your eggs cooked on both sides, flip and cook for a few seconds (no more than 20, or the yolk will start to set). </li><li>
					
			Place the tortilla chips into the large pan with the salsa roja, and very carefully toss until they are completely coated. </li><li>
					
			Remove chilaquiles to a large serving platter – top with fried egg and any optional toppings you may want! </li></ul>

		<li>Candy Spiders, worms or preferred candy decorations</li></ul></div>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ul><li>For the cake: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of two 9-inch round cake pans with parchment and grease the parchment and the sides of the pans with oil.</li>
		<li>Stir together the cocoa powder and boiling water in a small bowl and let sit to bloom for 5 minutes (this step intensifies the chocolate flavor in the cake).</li>
		<li>Whisk together the granulated sugar, flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the bloomed cocoa, oil, milk, eggs and vanilla in a medium bowl. Pour the cocoa mixture into the sugar mixture and stir until smooth (the batter will be thin). Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake until the cakes bounce back when pressed in the middle and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool completely in the pans on a rack.</li><li>For the filling and frosting: Heat the cream in a double boiler over low heat, whisking occasionally, until it begins to steam. Whisk in the cocoa powder, chocolate, espresso powder, vanilla and salt until the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the butter until melted. Whisk in the confectioners' sugar until incorporated. Let the frosting cool completely. (add food coloring for desired color)</li><li><b>To assemble:</b> Put 1 cake, bottom-side up, on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread about 1 cup of the frosting over the top but not all the way down the side. Top with the other cake, bottom-side up, and frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.</li><li><b>For the monster decoration:</b> Microwave the marshmallows in a microwave-safe medium bowl until they swell and are soft enough to stir, about 1 minute. Let sit a few minutes until cool enough to touch. Spray your hands with cooking spray. For a spider web, pick up a tablespoon-sized blob of the melted marshmallow and stretch it over and around the cake; repeat so that the strings of marshmallow crisscross one another in many directions, and continue until you have what looks like a spider web. Add two marshmallows for the eyes (dab chocolate for pupils), Garnish with a candy spiders or preferred finishes..</li><h3>Chef's Notes</h3><i>The candy decorations are a nice touch, but the cake will be fun and delicious without them as well. When measuring flour, we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off the excess. (Scooping directly from the bag compacts the flour, resulting in dry baked goods.)</i></ul>

		<li>¼ c granulated sugar</li>
		<li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
		<li>4 Cups Water</li></ul></div>

		<ul><li>Bring water to a boil. Once boiling, remove from heat, drop in tea bags, and let steep for 10 minutes. </li>
		<li>After 10 minutes, remove and discard tea bags. Stir in the sugar (you can adjust to taste) and allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
		<li>After cooling, transfer to a pitcher and place in the fridge to cool completely.</li>
		<li>After a few hours of chilling, enjoy your tea over ice, with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. </li>
		<li>Tea will remain fresh in the fridge for about a week before it will start to sour, so don’t let it linger!</li></ul>	
		<span>Notes: For all our international guild members, “Iced Tea” bags are a special, specific thing. Don’t use just any tea bags to make this! Lipton is the best known brand here in the US. Their “Iced Tea” branded tea bags are significantly larger than standard tea bags. If you can’t find the “Iced Tea” bags, use 4 regular-sized Lipton brand tea bags instead. </span>

		<strong>(crust) Ingredients</strong><ul>
		<li>2.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>6 Tbsp sugar</li>
		<li>½ tsp salt</li>
		<li>2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, cut into ½ inch cubes</li>
		<li>2 large egg yolks</li>
		<li>2 Tbsp whipping cream</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>(filling) Ingredients</strong><ul>
		<li>½ cup whipping cream</li>
		<li>2 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
		<li>2 large eggs</li>
		<li>4 large egg yolks</li>
		<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
		<li>½ cup white balsamic vinegar</li>

		<li>½ stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter</li></ul>
		<strong>(topping) Ingredients</strong><ul>
		<li>1 pint fresh blueberries</li>
		<li>1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes</li></ul></div>
		<h3>(Crust) Instructions</h3>
		<ul><li>In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar and salt and pulse briefly to combine. Add the cubes of butter and pulse to blend until a coarse meal forms. Add egg yolks and whipping cream. Pulse until clumps begin to form. Remove from food processor, and use your hands to work the dough into a b4ll. </li>
		<li>Press dough into a 9” diameter tart pan with removable bottom. The crust layer should be no more than ¼” thick. Be sure to press the dough up the sides of the pan, too. Peirce dough all over with a fork. Move to fridge and chill for one hour.</li>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 375 °F. Line the tart with parchment and fill with pie weights (rice or dry beans work if you don’t have ceramic pie weights). Bake until the crust is golden, about 22 minutes. Once baked, cool completely.</li></ul><h3>(Filling) Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>In a large bowl, combine whipping cream and cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add the eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla, and whisk to blend.</li>
		<li>In a medium saucepan, boil the white balsamic vinegar until reduced to ¼ cup (about 3 minutes). Add ¾ cup water, sugar, and butter. Stir until butter melts, then return the mixture to a boil. VERY gradually, whisk the vinegar mixture into the egg mixture. If you do this too fast, you could cook the eggs which is not what you want to do! Pour a slow stream of the hot liquid into the egg mixture, and whisk continuously until completely incorporated.</li>
		<li>Return the mixture back to the saucepan. Whisk until the custard thickens and boils, about 2-3 minutes. Strain into a bowl and cool completely. </li>
		<li>Spread the custard into the crust, then cover and chill the tart for at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours. </li></ul><h3>(Decorating) Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>First, toast the coconut. Preheat the oven to 325 °F. Spread the coconut in a thin layer on a baking sheet, and bake for 5-10 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Keep a close eye on your coconut, as once the browning process begins, it happens fast! Cool toasted coconut completely before using.</li>
		<li>Decorate the tart with blueberries arranged in a crescent moon shape, then add the toasted coconut to the center of the tart. Viola, a fancy and delicious Blueberry Moon Tart!</li></ul><h3>Notes from the Chef:</h3>

		6-8 soft peaches, peeled, halved, pitted and cut into wedges</li></ul></div>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ul><li>  1) Make the pastry: Combine the flours, sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse until blended. Add in the butter cubes and pulse until the mixture looks like sand. In a small bowl or cup, whisk together the egg and milk until blended, then pour into the food processor and pulse until the dough just forms a clump. Do not overwork the dough, or it will get tough. 
	    </li><li> Flour your work surface, and turn the dough out onto the surface. Form into a b4ll, then flatten into a disk 1” thick. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 1 day. 
	    </li><li> When the dough is chilled, preheat oven to 375°F. 
	    </li><li> Prepare the peaches by stirring together the flour, sugar and cinnamon. Place the sliced peaches in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar mixture over the top, then toss gently to combine. Set aside while you work the dough.
	    </li><li>Take the dough out of the fridge and let rest for about 10 minutes. Then, on a floured sheet of parchment paper, roll the dough into a circle about 11 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick. Transfer the dough and the parchment paper to a rimmed baking sheet. 
	    </li><li>Starting 1.5 inches from the edge of the pastry, place the peach wedges in a single layer, working your way around the edge of the pastry then in towards the center. Once all peaches are placed, fold up the 1.5” edge around the peaches and crimp into place. Brush the pastry border with the beaten egg or heavy cream (your choice) and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. 
	    </li><li>Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling.

		<ul><li>  1) Preheat the oven to 375 °F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
	    </li><li>In a large bowl or stand mixer, beat together butter and sugars until fluffy. Add in the molasses and vanilla extract, then the egg. Beat until light and smooth.

	    </li><li>Flatten the dough into a disk, then wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to two days. 
	    </li><li>While the dough is chilling, unwrap the hard candies and crush with a mallet until they are tiny shards (be sure to separate the candies by color, if you’re using multiple colors)
	    </li><li> Once the dough has chilled, roll the dough into a sheet about ¼” thick, then cut with cookie cutters.

		</li></ul><b>NOTE:</b> <i>Many shops carry tzatziki sauce. If you can't find it, or you'd like to make your own, take 1 cup of unsweetened, plain Greek-style yogurt and mix it with 1 clove of minced garlic and about 1/4 cup of peeled, diced, drained cuke. Mix well, add in a little vinegar or lemon juice to taste (very little will do), then refrigerate for at least two hours to let the flavours really come together.</i>

		<strong>For the Lemon Cake | 12 servings</strong>

		<div id="reci-b">
		<strong>For the Lemon Frosting</strong>
		<ul><li>
		1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li><li>
		4 cups powdered sugar</li><li>
		3 tablespoons cream</li><li>
		2 tablespoons lemon juice</li><li>
		1/2 teaspoon lemon extract</li><li>
		1/4 teaspoon golden yellow food color</li></ul>
		</div>

		<div id="reci-b">
		<strong>For Decorating</strong>
		<ul><li>
		1 large box Orange Fondant*</li><li>
		1 small package yellow Fondant</li><li>
		Cornstarch</li></ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
		<ul><li>Make the cake layers: Heat the oven to 350°F.
		Spray three 8-inch round cake pans with flour-based baking spray. Line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper. In a bowl, mix the flour, baking powder and salt. In a separate large bowl or stand mixer, beat the sugar and 3/4 cup butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well. Beat in the lemon extract. On low speed, alternately beat in the flour mixture and milk until blended. Add the food color and beat on low speed until a consistent color is achieved. Scr.ape down bowl as needed and re-mix briefly.</li><li>

		Pour the batter into the prepared pans (about 2 cups batter per pan). Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until a tooth pick comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the cake pans and level with a cake leveler or serrated knife. Return the leveled cakes to their pans. Using a fork, poke the tops of the cake at 1-inch spaces. Whisk together 1 cup powdered sugar and 1/3 cup lemon juice until smooth. Spoon the glaze over the cakes. Let stand 10 minutes. Remove from the cake pans; place the cakes on a cooling rack (glazed side-up) and let cool completely, about 1 hour. Cover two cakes with 1/2 cup of lemon curd each. Stack the cakes, ending with the plain cake layer on top. </li><li>

		Make the lemon frosting: In a large bowl, beat 1 1/2 cups butter, 4 cups powdered sugar, cream, lemon juice and lemon extract on low speed until well blended. Beat 3 minutes on medium speed; scr.ape down the bowl. Add the golden yellow food color a little at a time until a light golden color is achieved. Beat on high speed until fluffy, about 2 more minutes. Cover the entire cake with frosting using an offset spatul<b>A.</b> Chill the cake while you prepare the decor.</li><li>

		When the icing is well set, remove the cake from the refrigerator. Roll out the orange fondant and cut strips to line the edges of the cake, then cut triangles to create a sun pattern. Use the yellow fondant to make the sun center. To attach to the cake, either let the buttercream come to room temperature and apply the fondant to the more pliable surface, or simply wet one side of the fondant with a small amount of water and stick wet-side-down onto the cake. </li><ul>
		<i>*if you can’t find orange fondant, yellow fondant with a small bit of red fondant mixed in will do the trick!</i></ul>

	<a name="kelp"></a><p id="blurb">For those of you non-Neopians, Maraqua is an underwater land within the Neopets world. I was immediately excited, because one of my favorite Neopian things is in Maraqua – Kelp, Neopia’s equivalent of a three-Michelin-starred restaurant. Even as a kid, I thought the food served at Kelp looked amazing and I always wanted to try it. Well, now that I’m an adult, I can! So I set out to create a full Kelp dinner, and then write down the recipes to share with my guild mates! <br><br>
	I hope you try these Neopian delicacies and have as much fun making them as I did! If you ever have questions or need help with a recipe, feel free to reach out to me! - <a href="/~athelaya#thebanditrocks">thebanditrocks</a> (Erica) <br><br></p>

			<i>(Beef Tenderloin with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus)</i><br>
			<i>2 servings</i>

					
			<h4>Ingredients Needed</h4>
					
			<div id="reci-b">
					
			<strong>!For the Steak:</strong>
					
			<ul><li>
					
			2 8 oz portions beef tenderloin or filet mingon </li><li>
					
			Salt and pepper</li><li>
					
			2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li><li>
					
			1Tbsp canola or vegetable oil (see note 1)</li><li>
					
			1 radish, for garnish (optional)</li></ul></div>

					
			
					
			<div id="reci-b">
					
			<strong>!For the Cranberry Pan Sauce:</strong>
					
			<ul><li>
					
			1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar</li><li>
					
			3 Tbsp soy sauce</li><li>
					
			3 Tablespoons whole-berry cranberry sauce</li><li>
					
			6 Tbsp water</li></ul></div>

					
			
					
			<div id="reci-b">
					
			<strong>!For the Potatoes:</strong><ul><li>
					
			1.5 lb petite purple or blue potatoes</li><li>
					
			1 Tbsp salt</li><li>
					
			3 Tbsp unsalted butter</li><li>
					
			3-4 Tbsp heavy cream</li></ul></div>

					
			
					
			<div id="reci-b">
					
			<strong>!For the Asparagus:</strong><ul><li>
					
			1 bunch asparagus</li><li>
					
			2 Tbsp olive oil</li><li>
					
			Salt and pepper</li>
					
			</ul></div>
					
			

					
			<h3>Cooking Directions</h3>

					
			<ul><li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. <br>
			Trim the asparagus by cutting 1” from the bottom of each stalk. Peel the potatoes and dice into quarters.</li><li>
		Place the potatoes in a large pot, then add water <i>(enough to cover the potatoes by about 1” of water)</i>. <br>
			Toss in the salt, place on stove and bring to a boil. 

					
			</li><li>Allow potatoes to boil for 10-12 minutes, or until they are easily pierced by a fork. <br>
			While the potatoes are boiling, start the asparagus and the steak.</li><li>
		Place the asparagus on the baking sheet, drizzle olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper over the asparagus, and toss to coat. <br>
			Spread the asparagus into one layer and roast in the oven for 10-15 minutes. </li><li>
					
			Once the asparagus is in the oven and the potatoes are boiling, preheat a heavy cast iron sk1llet on the stovetop over medium-high heat for 5-10 minutes. <br>
			Cast iron is heavy and takes time to heat thoroughly, so handle it with caution. Once the pan is very hot, add the oil <i>(just enough to coat the bottom of the pan)</i>. </li><li>
		Season both sides of the steaks liberally with salt and pepper, and then add them to the hot cast iron sk1llet.<br>
			 Sear one side for 1-2 minutes, then flip over and sear the other side for about the same length of time (see note 2 below). </li><li>
		 Once both sides are seared, flip back to the side you started on, and let cook for 3-4 minutes 
					
			 adding 1 Tbsp of butter to the top of each steak and let melt. <br>
			 Then flip again and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes. </li><li>
		 Finally, use tongs to stand the steak on its side and sear the edges. This should only take a minute or so. If you’re not sure about doneness, the best way to test is to use a thermometer: Medium Rare 135°F, Medium 140°F, Medium Well 145°F. <br>
			Once done, remove steaks to a plate and let rest for 10 minutes. </li><li>
		Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain the water and move potatoes to a large bowl. Using a potato masher (or a large fork or a handheld electric mixer) mash the potatoes to your desired consistency. Add the butter and cream and mix well until the butter is fully melted. If desired, continue adding cream 1 Tbsp at a time until you’re satisfied with the taste and texture. </li><li>
					
			To make the cranberry pan sauce, add all ingredients to the pan you just cooked the steak in, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and syrupy (about 2-3 minutes). Remove pan from the heat.</li><li>
					
			To assemble, place asparagus spears in a wheel pattern, then spoon the mashed potatoes on top. Place a steak on top of the mashed potatoes, and drizzle with the pan sauce. Add a radish for garnish (optional). <br>
			Enjoy!</li></ul>

					
			<uL><b>
					
			Note 1:</b> Any oil with a high smoke point is fine. Canola or vegetable oil work well, but this is not the right time for Extra Virgin Olive Oil!<br><b>
					
			Note 2:</b> It’s near impossible for me to tell you how to properly cook a steak. There are many variables, including whether you’re using a cast iron sk1llet like I used, a cast iron griddle pan, a stainless steel pan, a nonstick pan or a grill. It also depends on the thickness of your steak, and whether you let your steak sit at room temperature for 45 minutes before cooking (best practice), or if it’s been plucked straight from the fridge (that’s what I do, because I’m forgetful and don’t remember to take the steak out ahead of time…). And even then, it depends on how cold your fridge is versus mine. Not to mention that everyone has a different preference for steak doneness. To the best of my ability, this recipe is written to produce a medium-rare steak in a cast iron sk1llet on an electric stovetop using a 1” thick cut of beef tenderloin. </uL>

			<i>(Easy Chocolate Mousse in a Chocolate Bowl)<br>
			Serves 4, with 2 Chocolate bowls</i>

					
			<div id="reci-b"><strong>Ingredients</strong>
					
			<ul><li>
					
			3 cups heavy whipping cream, divided</li><li>
					
			12 ounces (2 cups) semi-sweet Chocolate chips</li><li>
					
			2 pirouette cookies (optional, for garnish)</li><li>
					
			!For Chocolate Bowls</li><li>
					
			3 bags Chocolate candy melts, any colors</li><li>
					
			4 b4lloons</li><li>
					
			Cooking spray</li></ul></div>

					
			<h3>Chocolate Mouse : Cooking Instructions</h3>
					
			<ul><li>
					
			Microwave 1 cup of heavy whipping cream in a large microwave safe bowl for 1 minute. Add the Chocolate chips, stir slightly. Microwave the mixture for another 30 seconds, then stir until the Chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is smooth, silky and a rich Chocolate color. Set aside to cool. </li><li>
					
			In the bowl of a stand mixer <i>(or using a large bowl and hand mixer)</i> whip the remaining 2 cups cream on high speed until it is stiff. </li><li>
					
			Add the whipped cream to the bowl of now-cooled Chocolate ganache, and fold gently to combine. It’s okay if there’s still some white flecks of whipped cream in your mixture – just be careful not to overmix, or the whipped cream could deflate.</li><li>
					
			Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least two hours until you’re ready to serve.</li><li>
					
			To serve, either transfer the mixture to a piping bag and pipe into bowls, or simply scoop the mousse with a spoon into serving bowls.</li></ul>

					
			<h3>Chocolate Bowls : Cooking Instructions</h3>
					
			<ul><li>
					
			Inflate two b4lloons to your desired bowl size. Wash well, and dry thoroughly. Then, spray liberally with a nonstick cooking spray, or coat with some olive oil. Rub the b4lloon to ensure the nonstick spray is applied evenly.</li><li> 
					
			In a microwave-safe bowl, melt ½ a bag of Chocolate melts according to the package directions. This should be your “base color,” or whatever you want the main structure of the bowl to be. I used dark Chocolate melts.</li><li>
					
			Once melted, use a silicone spatula to spread the melted Chocolate over the b4lloon to the desired height of your bowl. I recommend doing this over the sink, as it is likely to drip and cause a mess. Make sure the layer is thick enough that you can no longer see the b4lloon through the Chocolate.</li><li>
					
			Place a spoonful of melted Chocolate onto parchment paper on a baking sheet. Once you are done with your base layer, place the b4lloon Chocolate-side-down onto the tray, and hold it in place for a few seconds to let it set. Move the whole tray to the fridge to chill for 15 minutes.</li><li>
					
			If you are making more than one b4lloon, repeat this process with your second b4lloon while the first waits in the fridge.</li><li>
					
			After the base layer of Chocolate has set, it’s time to add your accent colors. Add ¼ package of Chocolate melts (in whatever accent color you choose) to a piping bag or Ziplock (be sure to close with rubber band to prevent leaking!).</li><li>
					
			 Microwave until melted, and massage the bag to ensure all Chocolate melts are melted. Cut off the tip of the bag (as wide or as narrow as you wish, depending on the design you’d like). Take one of the now-cold b4lloons from the fridge, and pipe the accent color onto it in whatever pattern you choose. </li><li>
					
			 Once you are done, return the b4lloon to the fridge and allow to chill for another 15 minutes. Repeat this step for as many b4lloons or colors that you have.</li><li>
					
			Once the Chocolate has set, remove b4lloons from fridge. Cut a very small hole in the top of the b4lloon, near the tie (you want it to deflate as slowly as possible, not pop!). Slowly peel the b4lloon away from the bowl until it is completely removed. Return bowls to fridge until you’re ready to serve.</li></ul>

			In the bowl of a stand mixer, add chilled egg whites and sugar. Make sure your mixing bowl and whisk attachment are completely clean and dry. If there is any oil, your egg whites won't turn into meringue. Whip on the highest speed your mixer allows, until stiff peaks form. (About 2-3 minutes.)

			Using a spatula, scoop out one-third of the meringue and add to your egg yolk batter. Gently fold the meringue into the batter until there are no more white streaks. Make sure you start your folds from the bottom so that the batter at the bottom of the bowl doesn't go unmixed. You need to be gentle when folding. If you mix too hard, the meringue will lose its structure. Once the meringue has been incorporated, add in another third. Fold in. And then the final third. At the end, you batter should be very light and airy, with the meringue only just incorporated to the point where there are not visible white streaks.</li><li>
					
			If this is your first time making these, you may want to start with just one as a test, to determine the heat setting for your stove and how long to cook the pancakes. But the directions I am sharing is for how I would normally cook these. Add two ring molds to a large sk1llet. Spray the insides of the ring molds with cooking oil spray. I found that this is the best method to grease, as it completely greases the interior of the molds and also the bottom where the pancakes will be, but doesn't spread grease to the rest of the parts of the pan you won't be using.</li><li>
					
			Bring your sk1llet to low heat. It may take a test one to figure out where exactly you want your heat setting. For me, I turned my dial to heat setting 4 (with 10 being the highest) on my gas stove top. Once the oil and pan are hot, fill each ring mold between 1/2 to 2/3 full with batter, allowing some room for them to rise. Add 1/2 tbsp of water to each side of the pan (preferably not touching the pancakes). Close the lid and allow to cook about 3-4 minutes.</li><li>
					
			Your pancakes are ready to flip when the tops look almost completely cooked and you can move the bottom of the pancakes without batter spilling out. Use a spatula or turner to flip the pancakes (while still in their molds). I prefer to use a cookie spatula because they are thinner and slip under the molds easier.</li><li>
					
			Cover and cook for another 2-3 minutes until pancakes are completely cooked and golden brown on both top and bottom. Place pancakes onto plate. Gently push out of the molds to remove from molds. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm with syrup, powdered sugar, whipped cream, fruit, or other toppings of your choice.	</li></ul>

			<strong class="bord">See the facts and all major updates regarding the metaverse NFT controversary below (Updates from JN)</strong>
			<span style="font-size:7pt; text-transform:lowercase;">A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files. Access to any copy of the original file, however, is not restricted to the buyer of the NFT. While copies of these digital items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs are tracked on blockchains to provide the owner with a proof of ownership that is separate from copyright.<br><br><I>In other words, NFTs are digital slips of paper that name you as the owner of some digital asset. However, you don't own the copyright to the material—the original creator still has rights over your asset. Accessing your NFT asset and maintaining its resale value is also dependent on several organizations remaining online, functional, and in business.</I></span>


			<h2>Story Briefing</h2>	

			Since the introduction of the Metaverse NFT Project, the entire community has been 100% against the idea and major fan sites are speaking out in grave protest. Not only was TNT unaware of the project in the beginning and clearly has no part in the design, the third party license has stumbled every step of the way. Whether they be insulting users, stealing digital assets, tweeting r-rated material or making unprofessional or even minority-biased comments - it's safe to say that no one is on board with this project and many are willing to go to great lengths to save their beloved fansite from this abomination. <br><br>

		<h2>Major Updates</h2>
		<h4>11.17 : Dave, JN : Metaverse Launches, Scam Pops Up Stealing $73,00</h4>
			The Neopets Metaverse launched early this morning at 1:00 AM NST. As of writing (5:45 PM NST), 3,888 of the 10,000 available for sale have sold.<br>
			<br>
			At time of writing, we at Jellyneo have an-alyzed the Neopets Metaverse team's cryptowallet, and they currently have a balance of 7,845 SOL, which is worth roughly $1,800,000 USD.<br>
			<br>
			As we (JN) reported earlier (see below update), the sale price of each NFT <em>increases</em> as more of them sell. The first 250 NFTs sold, for example, were available for 1 SOL (~$230 USD), and the 9,751st through 10,000th NFTs that sell will sell for 4 SOL (~$920 USD). With 3,888 sold so far, the price is stuck at 2.5 SOL (~$575) per NFT.<br>
			<br>
			As predicted, when the sale went live at 1:00 AM NST this morning, the cheap NFTs for 1.0 and 1.5 SOL were bought immediately by autobuyers, leaving most of today's stock for humans at 2.0 to 2.5 SOL each.<br>
			<br>
			The sale period only lasts until November 15th (for a total of 3 days). Currently, it is not expected for all 10,000 NFTs to sell out, and as such, the Metaverse team has announced that any remaining stock will be "burned" and simply not made available.<br>
			<br>
			Several hundred of the NFTs (exact number unknown) have been reserved as gifts for the Neopets Metaverse team members, so they will make out like bandits at the end of this, assuming the aftermarket price of each Neopet NFT doesn't tank.<br>
			<br>
			<div class="text-center"><img src="https://images.neopets.com/neopedia/198_aftermath.gif"></div>
			<br>
			Unfortunately, as part of launch day, a scam on Twitter gained heavy traction. A fake Neopets Metaverse profile was set up and lured in unsuspecting NFT folks interested in the Neopets minting to a fake website that would steal all of the money in their wallet. Twitter finally suspended the profile, but not before the scammers made off with 319.31208822 SOL (~$73,000 USD).<br>
			<br>
		<h4>11.15 : Dave, JN : Metaverse Project Stumbles to Finish Line</h4>
			SOL has reached a value of 1 SOL = $250 USD! That means the price for Neopets NFTs can range from $250 up to $1,000 <em>each</em>! In all likelihood, the cheaper NFTs will be snatched up by autobuyers, so any supporters of the project will be stuck purchasing at highly inflated prices.<br>
			<br>
			
			Big news late this Friday evening: the Neopets Metaverse is <em>finally</em> launching on November 12th at 9:00 UTC (aka 1:00 AM NST for us Neopians)&mdash;only a month behind schedule.<br>
			<br>
			However, the bigger news: each NFT will sell for up to 4 SOL, which at time of writing would convert to ~$960 USD.<br>
			<br>
			The number of NFTs have also been severely cut, with now only 10,500 on offer (with 500 of those being reserved for giveaways). Prior to today's announcement, there were plans for 20,500 NFTs. It's unknown exactly why the number on sale has been cut in half, but our speculation is that it's due to either production troubles or fear that they would not sell out. The Metaverse team has said a few times during the project's delay that they were encountering issues producing the NFTs. (And most of the samples they've posted have had graphical issues.)<br>
			<br>
			Here is the exact pricing breakdown. It will be a race to buy the NFTs as quickly as you can, as the more that sell, the more expensive they become:<br>
			<br>
			<center><img src="https://imgur.com/fz6PKx3.png" class="img-screenshot"></center>
			<br>
			In other words, the first 250 sold will sell for 1 SOL, and then the price increases to 1.5 SOL for numbers 251 through 750. If all 10,000 sell, that will be 26,750 SOL (which at time of writing is ~$6,393,250 USD).<br>
			<br>
			The sale is slightly convoluted. You must buy tokens called "NMC" and then each NMC can be used to mint one actual NFT. So, (a) convert your local currency to SOL (Solana) cryptocurrency; (b) use SOL to buy NMCs; and then (c) use your NMCs to mint NFTs.<br>
			<br>
			The project was also slated to sell NMCs on the Raydium DropZone via a lottery-esque system. But instead that plan is being axed to instead use a more "bespoke" system that is on a "first come first serve basis." (Which the NFT community is concerned about, as it means bots can come and buy out the supply. In Neopian terms, it's like autobuyers buying all the good stuff when restocking.)<br>
			<br>
			At this point, the changes being made to the project mean little to us Neopians, but it seems that the Metaverse team is working overtime to upset the actual NFT supporters by inflating the price and removing the promised method of fair distribution.<br>
			<br>		
		<h4>11.11 : Dave, JN : Metaverse NFT Launch</h4>
			It's been almost two months since the Neopets Metaverse Collection (NMC) was first announced, and at long last, we can officially call this sales endeavour "done," as the minting process for claiming your NFT Neopets ended yesterday at 2:00 AM NST.<br><br>

			Here's a highlight of what we've endured during this project—a mess from beginning to end:<ul><li>

			A botched announcement where even TNT seemed to think the project was a scam.</li><li>
			An initial TNT response that largely ignored player concerns.</li><li>
			Homophobia and transphobia by the Metaverse moderation team.</li><li>
			The release of a grandiloquent roadmap for the NMC project that threatens the livelihood of the Neopets site.</li><li>
			A Twitter thread so deplorable and condescending that it was soon deleted and an apology issued for it.</li><li>
			A blackout supported by every official Neopets fan site, and amplified by a site blackout led by Neopians like you!</li><li>
			The censorship, and then un-censorship, of anti-NFT Beauty Contest entries.</li><li>
			A second TNT response that largely ignored player concerns.</li><li>
			Attempted doxxing of a user by one of the Metaverse moderators.</li><li>
			The announcement (then indefinite delay) of another digital collectible project, this time with Quidd.</li><li>
			Further delay of the Metaverse release timeline.</li><li>
			The announcement of a greedy and egregious pricing scheme that even NFT-ers hated.</li><li>
			The emergence of a scam version of the Metaverse that ran off with over $70,000 USD.</li><li>
			Lackluster sales for NMC after a launch plagued by bots.</li><li>
			The unveiling of the actual NFT Neopets, which included just 10 species, 58 wearables, and half of them crying.</li></ul><b>

			<img src="https://imgur.com/RmJVOoP.gif" class="img-xs" style="float:right;width:100px;padding:5px;"><br>
			
			<br>
			A few new and noteworthy updates today in the world of Neopets NFTs. (Or should we say in the <em>metaverse</em> of Neopets NFTs?<br>
			<br>
			First up, the Neopets Metaverse team is missing their launch schedule, with the NFT project failing to meet the self-imposed November deadline for release.<br>
			<br>
			In a statement posted (on their blog):<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>The team is working hard and focused on finalizing the details of the project to ensure a smooth and successful launch of the Neopets Metaverse Collection NFTs. As an update, we expect the NFT sale to take place in the next few weeks. We would like to express our deepest gratitude to our many supporters and are very excited to continue building and growing our community.</blockquote>
			<br>
			Originally, their announced date for launch was "November 2021." With the announcement above, no definitive timeline has been released, leaving the project in limbo.<br>
			<br>
			This doesn't seem all too surprising coming from the Neopets Metaverse team, though. They have continuously stumbled since the initial release (read back in our news feed to see), and the "roadmap" they posted for a brand new NFT-based version of Neopia has zero indication as to the timeline of completion. (As a reminder—the roadmap, which is authored by "Neopets Inc," also claims that the Neopets brand will be decentralized, and in effect given up by JumpStart and placed in control of those who own the NFTs. Something that TNT has yet to address, or retract.)<br>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			Second, you may have seen our post (see below), a marketplace for digital collectibles (with the option in the future to convert them to NFTs).<br>
			<br>
			As of today, we have confirmed that due to the Neopets Metaverse project, the collectibles planned for the Quidd marketplace have been put on hold, with this official statement:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>Quick update on the new channel coming! While we originally thought it would be this week, due to unforeseen circ.umstances it has been delayed slightly.<br>
			<br>
			It is still coming! And we will keep you updated as we find out more. For now we apologize for the confusion and hope to have more info for you very soon!</blockquote>
			<br>
			Later, the CEO of Quidd stated, during a Q&amp;A period held on their official Discord server:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote><em>[in a response to another project being canceled outright]</em> Yeah, it happens. It's a big bummer when it goes. I've seen the Charmed stuff -- it was incredible. But, sometimes licensors change their minds. In the case of the new [Neopets] channel, our partners wanted to put a little more time between another project that they dropped and our project. So, it's a delay, not a cancellation. I would say January at the latest.</blockquote>
			<br>
			We will continue to keep an eye out on this project, and update you all if it comes to fruition.<br>

			For those out of the loop or just checking in, you can read all about why Jellyneo opposes these NFT projects by visiting :jellyneo.net/nfts  (and mint your own blockchain-free NFTopet!) Alternatively, click the #NoNeoNFTs banner at the top of many pages across Jellyneo.<br>
			<br>
			Our stance here at Jellyneo continues to be the belief that the best course of action is to cancel all NFT projects outright, and instead focus on features and games that the Neopets community <em>actually wants</em>. If contracts cannot be canceled, then we believe the second best option would be to retract the Metaverse roadmap presented and cancel the planned NFT version of Neopia.
		<h4>10.19 : Dave, JN : MORE DIGITAL CONTENT</h4>

			<strong class="bord">UPDATE November 22nd:</strong> Quidd has postponed the Neopets product release "due to unforeseen circ.umstances"—no new date or timeline has been given for release.<br>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<strong class="bord">UPDATE November 21st:</strong> The Discord message has also now been deleted, but then reposted without the image (that tied it to Neopets) and the indication of when it would be announced changed to be 'soon'.<br>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<strong class="bord">UPDATE November 20th:</strong> The original teaser tweet has now been deleted. It is un-clear why. The equivalent message within Quidd's discord remains up.<br>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			JumpStart has heard the Neopets community loud and clear—and more digital collectibles that you can buy and sell in an online digital marketplace (and cash out as NFTs) are coming soon. <br>
			<br>
			This time, online seller Quidd, will be selling the collectibles. Currently, Quidd offers collectibles that <em>can</em> be minted as NFTs if you want, or you can keep them as non-cryptocollectibles.<br>						
		<h4>10.11 : Dave, JN : tnt response</h4>

			Earlier this evening, TNT <a href="http://www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161283187">posted a response</a> to this weekend's blackout and #NoNeoNFTs protest.<br>
			<br>
			Most notably, TNT is apologizing for the disaster that the Neopets Metaverse project has been so far, including the actions and behaviors of the Metaverse team. In addition, it's been announced that Petra is no longer in an official community management role for Neopets, and is instead working on other "critical tasks" within JumpStart.<br>
			<br>
			Disappointingly, there is no indication whatsoever that the Metaverse project will be canceled. We at Jellyneo believe the best course of action is to cancel the project outright. If that is not feasible, then we believe the second best option would be to retract the roadmap presented and cancel the planned NFT version of Neopia.<br>
			<br>
			We believe cancellation is the way to go, because at this point, the Neopets Metaverse has tarnished the Neopets name and soured many Neopians' opinions on JumpStart as the "stewards" of the Neopets brand. We have seen countless expressions of disappointment across Neopia and social media for this project. And now, as you'll read in the statement below, JumpStart employees <em>will</em> be getting involved due to the incompetence of the Metaverse team, taking valuable resources that <em>could</em> have been spent on Neopets.com instead. If JumpStart is so stretched that the Neopets community manager has been re-assigned already, what tasks will fall by the wayside now that the Metaverse is getting professional moderation help by JumpStart?<br>
			<br>
			As a reminder, this is the <em>second</em> failed attempt to bring cryptocollectibles to Neopets, and we're tired of it. <br>
			<br>
			Here's the message in full:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>Hi everyone,<br>
			<br>
			We would like to apologize to the Neopets community, our community of advocates, and our newfound supporters. As we embark on the exploration of a new frontier through the release of Neopets NFTs, it is important that we at JumpStart remain mindful of the impact such a massive change can have on a fanbase that has been as dedicated as you all have been, for as long as you all have been. Recently, our communication has fallen well short of showing that we have that awareness, and the result has been communication or content that many considered to be disrespectful at best. We are deeply sorry about that.<br>
			<br>
			As the stewards of a brand that is beloved by thousands of people, it is our duty to cultivate an environment that is as welcoming and inclusive as we can manage to make it. We have significant improvements to make on this front as it pertains to our NFT partnerships, so we would like to take this opportunity to clarify a few points:<br>
			<br>
			- Neopets.com is not going away, nor is it being replaced by the Neopets Metaverse. As stated in a previous announcement, our involvement in the NFT project is happening independent of the support we provide to the Neopets site and will not interfere with our development plans.<br>
			<br>
			- Cherrypicks, Moonvault, Raydium, and Solana are our NFT partners who work separately from the Neopets Team (TNT) who support the Neopets.com site.<br>
			<br>
			- Please know that our partner's social media accounts are managed independently and do not reflect the views of The Neopets Team (TNT) or JumpStart Games. To help ensure an experience that better aligns with our product's values, we will be assisting with management of these in the future.<br>
			<br>
			-The Neopets Metaverse Discord has been the subject of much controversy on the site due to the content allowed on the channel by a third party. In the near future, JumpStart will be present and assisting with moderation.<br>
			<br>
			- Many of you have wondered about where staff from TNT have been during this turbulent time, in particular, TNT Petrichor. Petra has moved away from Community Management and is now assisting the company with other critical tasks, hence their absence. Our apologies for not being able to announce this sooner. Don't worry, Petra is still with JumpStart and may even pop in from time to time to say hi! As for the rest of the team, we are working on finding ways to engage with you all more frequently and clearly while being mindful of our obligations to partners.<br>
			<br>
			- After consideration, we have decided to allow NFT related entries into the Beauty Contest.<br>
			<br>
			Please know we remain dedicated to improving the Neopets site and will have more site conversions, updates, and new features for you soon. Thank you for your patience and understanding.<br>
			<br>
			The TNT Team</blockquote>

		<h4>10.07 : Dave, JN : Roadmap Released</h4> 

			<img src="https://images.neopets.com/pets/beaten/acara_rainbow_baby.gif" class="img-xs" style="float:right;width:100px;padding:5px;">
			<br>
			A roadmap for the much maligned Neopets Metaverse NFT project has been released—and boy is it a lot of words saying nothing in particular. Even with the generic terms used ("There's gonna be PvP! And PvE! And progression! And it'll all be NFTs!"), the roadmap is extremely aspirational. No specific features mentioned, but there are some good nuggets that we think you should be aware of.<br>
			<br>
			To start:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>This update is brought to you by the Neopets team, project owner and lead of the Neopets Metaverse Collection NFT.</blockquote>
			<br>
			The first line out of the gate seems to walk back what was said earlier this week that the NFT project would not be impacting the Neopets.com team's ability to develop Neopets.com. With the Metaverse team members continuing to be obtuse about development organization, either the Neopets Metaverse team is <em>intentionally</em> misleading the community again that TNT is involved, or TNT's earlier statement that it was entirely run by a third party was a lie. (As you'll see, the roadmap is signed off as "Neopets, Inc." as well.)<br>
			<br>
			Continuing on:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>Our long term vision is to create a single application which players can use to interact with the entire Neopets Metaverse.</blockquote>
			<br>
			An entirely new version of Neopia is coming soon to a device near you—in three different stages. What's included? Let's break it down for you.<br>
			<br>
			So-called "Stage 1" of the roadmap includes:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>  * player assets represented by a combination of fungible tokens and NFTs;<br>
			  * compatibility and interaction with other fungible tokens and NFTs;<br>
			  * progression of Neopets (gaining experience points, leveling up, achievements etc.);<br>
			  * PvP gameplay and mechanisms;<br>
			  * PvE gameplay and mechanisms;<br>
			  * development and sale of parcels of in-game land;<br>
			  * in-game social interaction with other players; and<br>
			  * user generated content where developers and creators can make games on the Neopian Metaverse assets and host them on virtual land plots.</blockquote>
			<br>
			In other words, this new version of Neopia will be pay-to-win (all assets "represented by a combination of fungible tokens and NFTs"—pay for the Giant Omelette!) It will be able to interact with "other fungible tokens and NFTs", including the possibility of the R-rated NFT project the Metaverse team was congratulating last month. (Yay, porn in Neopia!) You'll somehow train your Neopet—but oddly, core gameplay actions like feeding it, caring for it, and customising it seem to be absent. And most interestingly, it will also have user-generated content—but more on that with "Stage 3".<br>
			<br>
			The second stage of the project involves implementing a "pay-to-earn" economy, meaning if you play the game, you'll be awarded with NFTs.<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>This is what we want to create with the Neopian Metaverse — a universe where any player can earn tokens through skil.led gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. The construction and implementation for this Stage 2 will occur after the completion and finalization of Stage 1.</blockquote>
			<br>
			So, once they've grabbed all your cash during stage 1's heavy pay-to-win version, <em>then</em> they'll toss in the freebies!<br>
			<br>
			"Stage 3" of the roadmap involves decentralizing the game and taking it out of the hands of JumpStart and The Neopets Team:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>In addition, we see that the Neopian Metaverse could gradually evolve into a community-powered initiative (and potentially over time a decentralized autonomous organization).<br>
			<br>
			...<br>
			<br>
			This will also coincide with the project team’s ownership becoming less concentrated and therefore adding to the pace of decentralization.<br>
			<br>
			...<br>
			<br>
			Our ideal outcome is for the players and participants to organically grow and bloom into a vibrant and self-sustaining community that will be able to submit development proposals and vote on the direction of the Neopian Metaverse without our team’s intervention.</blockquote>
			<br>
			In other words, the Neopets Metaverse team wants to build a game, step away from it, and allow <em>anyone</em> to develop content for it. We can only imagine what kinds of fun content random internet users will come up with! Consistent lore? What's that? Family-friendly brand content? Maybe, but also likely no.<br>
			<br>
			Lastly:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>This article is issued by Neopets Inc. It is intended for informational purposes only regarding our future plans. It is not intended to be legally binding, nor is it intended to be an offer, solicitation or advice of any kind. Any forward-looking statements or information involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual events to differ materially.

			<br>
			Aka none of this may even happen? (If we're lucky!)<br>

			The entire team here at Jellyneo is firmly against this project. In protest of the Neopets Metaverse project marching onward, Jellyneo will be hosting a sitewide blackout from Friday, November 8th at 9:00 AM NST through Sunday, November 10th at 11:59 PM NST. During this time, you will be presented with an interstitial page explaining why we believe the Metaverse NFT project is bad for Neopets. We will also have several actions that you can take to make sure that JumpStart hears its community—something it clearly hasn't done in awhile. We hope you'll join the protest with us!</center></div>

		<h4>10.21: More HTML5 Games & Maps</h4>

			It's been 78 days since the last beta site redesign, and a new release—v0.4.8—is now live!<br>
			<br>
			<b>1) Three more games receive HTML5 versions.</b> This round includes:<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.neopets.com/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1397">Alien Aisha Vender Machine</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.neopets.com/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1395">Faerie Bubbles</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.neopets.com/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1396">Ultimate Bullseye II</a></li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<s>As of writing, you cannot earn any NP from these 3 games just yet. We assume TNT is holding back on that for some live testing just to make sure there aren't any big issues.</s> As of November 22nd, score submissions for Neopoints have been enabled!<br>
			<br>
			Faerie Bubbles has a known issue where the blaster will still give you coloured bubbles that are not currently on the board (something the Flash version did not do). This makes it quite challenging to progress:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>The Faerie Bubbles Game has a balancing issue where colours not remaining in-game will show up to shoot, making the levels very difficult to pass. We are working to address this issue ASAP.</blockquote>
			<br>
			<b>2) Seven more world maps have been converted to HTML5.</b> This map conversion update includes:<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.neopets.com/objects.phtml">Neopia Central</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.neopets.com/market_bazaar.phtml">Neopian Bazaar</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.neopets.com/market_plaza.phtml">Neopian Plaza</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.neopets.com/worlds/index_kikolake.phtml">Kiko Lake</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.neopets.com/winter/index.phtml">Happy Valley</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.neopets.com/winter/icecaves.phtml">The Ice Caves</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.neopets.com/winter/terrormountain.phtml">Top of Terror Mountain</a></li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Oddly, <a href="https://www.neopets.com/altador/index.phtml">Altador</a> is included in the list as well (making it 8 maps), but the Altador map was previously converted in 2018. It seems to have gotten another update, probably to bring it in line with the newer maps.<br>
			<br>
			<b>3) Finally, Random Events make a return in the beta layout.</b> Previously, Random Events did not work on pages with the new layout and could only be received on the legacy site. No longer!<br>
			<br>
			<div class="text-center"><img src="https://imgur.com/6Fw72QR.png" class="img-screenshot"></div>
			<br>
			<b>What's coming up?</b><br>
			Pet Slots are still in the works, and TNT is aiming to have them for a holiday release. (Note that UCs are <em>not</em> part of the Pet Slots update, and will come later.) The Advent Calendar is also getting the new layout treatment in time for December 1st. More HTML5 map updates will be coming, as well.<br>

		<h4>08.27 : Pet Slots + Premium Sale + Charity Corner</h4>
					
			<center><img src="https://imgur.com/xmSbtAR.gif" style="width:20%;float:right;"></center>
					
			<br>
			Big updates were posted in this week's <a href="/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&issue=943">Neopian Times Editorial</a>! Perhaps one of the most exciting editorials in a long while. Here's a high level summary:<br>
			
					
			<strong class="bord">Annual Premium Sale</strong>
					
			It's late, but it's coming next week, so get ready! Not much else to say about this one other than nice to see confirmation. We expect it will be the usual $49.95 yearly sale price. If you're interested in Premium and would like an overview check out our Premium guide:<br>
			<br>
			<center><i>http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=premium</i></center>
					
			<strong class="bord">Charity Corner</strong>
					
			Long story short, no Charity Corner in 2021. They are taking the time to focus on other things&mdash;namely Pet Slots. They will also be adding a new TNT member soon to take a look at recurring events:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>We will soon be getting a new member of the team who will be taking a look at many of our events to see how to improve them and Charity Corner will be one of those, so hold on to your donations and Granny Hopbobbin will see you soon.</blockquote>
					
			<strong class="bord">Pet Slots!</strong>
					
			The big news this week is, additional pet slots are coming soon!<br>
			<br>
			<center><img src="https://images.neopets.com/items/mall_petslots_1.gif" style="margin:3px;"><img src="https://images.neopets.com/items/mall_petslots_5.gif" style="margin:3px;"><img src="https://images.neopets.com/items/mall_petslots_10.gif" style="margin:3px;"></center>
					
			<br>
			In total, you will be able to add +10 new Pet Slots to your account. In addition, Premium members will be receiving +3 pet slots as part of their membership. That means, after Pet Slots are released:<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
					
			<li>Premium users will have 10 total pet slots, plus the ability to purchase up to 10 more, for a total of 20 slots.</li>
					
			<li>Non-Premium users will have 6 total pet slots, plus the ability to purchase up to 10 more, for a total of 16 slots.</li>
					
			</ul>
					
			<br>
			Pet Slots will be purchasable in the NC Mall. The prices are currently unknown.<br>
			<br>
			There is currently no release date for Pet Slots (it's still in progress), but with all of this information being released, we imagine TNT is relatively close to having something for us soon!<br>
			<br>
			In the process, dealing with your +4 extra pet slots when you cancel your Premium membership will receive some tweaks:<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
					
			<li>When you cancel Premium, you still need to choose which Neopets will go away if you have more Neopets than slots (more than the free 6 slots plus whatever you purchased&mdash;in essence, the Neopets taking up your +4 free Premium slots).</li>
					
			<li>The 90-day window to reclaim your Neopets will go away. Instead, your Neopets will be sent to an "idle" limbo indefinitely until you renew Premium or purchase more Pet Slots.</li>
					
			<li>To get your Neopets out of limbo, you will need to renew Premium or purchase more pet slots (up to the allowed 16 non-Premium slots) to get them back.</li>
					
			</ul>
					
			<br>
			With this change, Transfer Limits in the Pound will also be temporarily lifted. This is so you will have easy ways to consolidate Neopets from your side accounts if you so wish to. TNT will confirm when those limits are being lifted, and when they will return. The ability to transfer Lutaris is also on the table! (But TNT hasn't confirmed this will definitely happen.)<br>
			<br>
			And that's about it! We encourage you to read the full editorial here:<br>

			<br>
		<h4>08.04 : More Converted Pages + Coming Soon</h4>
					
			A new update to the Neopets site redesign&mdash;v0.4.7&mdash;is now live! <br>
			<strong class="bord">1) A bunch of dailies and quest pages have been converted.</strong> <i>Nothing new, just a bunch more sections on some high-traffic areas have been brought into the new layout:</i><br>
			<br>
			<ul>
					
			<li><a href="/halloween/esophagor.phtml">Esophagor</a></li>
					
			<li><a href="/halloween/witchtower.phtml">Witch's Tower</a></li>
					
			<li><a href="/magma/quarry.phtml">Obsidian Quarry</a></li>
					
			<li><a href="/winter/snowager.phtml">Snowager</a></li>
					
			<li><a href="/halloween/gravedanger/index.phtml">Grave Danger</a></li>
					
			<li><a href="/medieval/wiseking.phtml">Wise Old King</a></li>
					
			<li><a href="/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">Grumpy Old King</a></li>
					
			<li><a href="/medieval/turmaculus.phtml">Turmaculus</a></li>
					
			<li><a href="/medieval/symolhole.phtml">Mysterious Symol Hole</a></li>
					
			</ul>
					
			<strong class="bord">2) The wheels of Neopia are now mobile friendly.</strong> You should have a bit more ease when spinning from your phone on the go (or from bed).<br>
			<br>
			<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YSqWfko.png" style="width:40%;"></center>
					
			<strong class="bord">3) As previously announced, the Meridell theme is live.</strong> From our earlier post:<br>
			<br>
			<center><img src="https://imgur.com/JD6Gb0C.png" style="width:60%;"><br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://imgur.com/Rmksu89.png" style="border:none;"></center>
					
			<strong class="bord">What's coming up?</strong>
					
			HTML5 maps are coming soon&mdash;or so TNT says. There are also some new HTML5 games in the works. Faerie Bubbles has been confirmed to be one of the next releases there!<br>
			<br>
			TNT has also posted that more information about additional pet slots should be forthcoming soon. Hopefully it's something we get to see by the end of August.<br>
			<br>
			Lastly, a big update about streamlining beta releases and a new community manager was announced:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>It's been a while since there's been a new beta update and Altador Cup had a lot to do with that. We're making a lot of changes internally to ensure that we get more frequent updates in a more consistent pace. We will also be communicating more frequently with the community about upcoming releases and plans with the help of our new Community Manager, who we will be introducing soon. Thank you for all your continued support!</blockquote>
					
			<br>

					
			<strong class="bord">August 5th Addendum:</strong> Another update was added in, talking about improvements to the Customisation page:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>At long last, updates to Customisation are here that will drastically improve your experience with the feature! Loading times have been improved. An issue of Neopets not showing up in thumbnails is fixed. The only caveat to this is that UC Pets still need to undergo some fixes, but these issues will be addressed prior to the re-release of UC Pets.<br>
			<br>
			If there are any further issues with Customisation (surrounding the page itself and not individual items), please reach out to our Customer Support with as much information as you can provide, including your username, number of pets, closet size, browser, and what you are experiencing.<br>
			<br>
			Please note that our recommended closet size is 650 items! If you have more than 2,500 items in your closet, you may want to move some to your Safety Deposit Box in order to improve loading times in Customisation.</blockquote>
					
			<br>
			If you're still having issues with the Customisation app itself, you should reach out to <a href="https://www.jumpstart.com/support/np-classic">Neopets support</a>.<br>

		<h4>05.30 : New Layout + NC Mall Updates</h4>
					
			<li>Updates slowed down a bit due to the Festival of Neggs and Altador Cup.</li><li>
					
			After the AC finishes, the team will be swinging back to the site redesign.</li><li>
					
			Next big release will be a big customization app fix. (Noted the issues with people loading the closet and items.)</li><li>
					
			After that, the NC Mall will be getting a revamp, and included will be UC Neopets! *party* (Price, and exact details not mentioned—temper your expectations!)</li><li>
					
			Aiming to keep UC pets still valuable, but far more accessible. (See our List of UC Neopets in the Image Emporium.)</li><li>
					
			Pet Slots will also be purchasable in the NC Mall in the update. (Again, exact details, price, limits, etc. not announced.)		</li>
		<h4>05.12 : Site Search, Create-a-Pet, and More Converted Pages!</h4>
					
			A new update to the Neopets site redesign—v0.4.6—is now live! And at long last... a full 91 days since the last beta update. This update contains a number of changes.<br><br><strong>1) Site search now lives in the new layout.</strong> Just click the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner to initiate a search box, and then search for any keywords you like. For example, "codestone":<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/3bfobUs.png" style="width: 70%; padding: 10px;"></center>
					
			<br><strong>2) The Community Central page has been converted.</strong> Not much else to say! Your Daily Puzzle is now easier to do from your phone if you wish.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/RbJrUjM.png" style="width: 70%; padding: 10px;"></center>
					
			<br><strong>3) The Create a Pet page has been completely redesigned.</strong> And now, your newly created Neopet will come with its very own <a href="-blocked-">Beginners Bandana</a> (in one of 4 colours). A very cute touch!<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/UsODWJ2.png" style="width: 70%; padding: 10px;"></center>
					
			<br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/EB5GvDY.png" style="width: 70%; padding: 10px;"></center>

			<br><strong>4) Various quest-givers have been moved to the new layout.</strong> Including Illusen, Jhudora, the Island Chef, the Brain Tree, and the Snow Faerie.<br><br>
			More importantly, the Island Chef will now only award stat bonuses <em>to your active Neopet</em>. (Cue the rejoicing from those training their Neopet.)<br><br><strong>5) Lastly, the Tyrannian site theme is now available in the new layout.</strong> To enable this new theme on redesigned pages, you need to choose it from the "Beta Theme" dropdown list on the <a href="/preferences.phtml">Site Preferences</a> page.<br><br>
			This site theme is a default theme, so you need to take no action to permanently unlock it.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/KgxWh5G.png" style="width: 70%; padding: 10px;"></center>
					
			<br>
			There are also a few other minor bug fixes, along with the addition of a few non-Flash games to the <a href="/games/">new Games Room</a>.<br><b>See Neopets official updates and news coverage in the <a href="/releasenotes/">Relese Notes</a>. <br>~ <i>Posted by 'Dave' @JellyNeo</i>
		<h4>02.15 : Site Redesign: A Few Bug Fixes // Posted by Dave @JellyNeo</h4>
					
			A new update to the Neopets site redesign—v0.4.5—is now live! This update contains a few new items and a theme:<br><br><strong>1) The Valentine's Day theme makes its redesigned debut.</strong> It's bright pink, filled with Chocolate, and has more hearts than you can count—fitting for a Valentine's theme:<br><br></b><center><img src="http://imgur.com/0LC83kG.png" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></center>
					
			<br>
			This theme is available to all Neopians during the beta period, but in order to keep the new theme you will need to either (a) already have it unlocked on the Classic site, or (b) send a Mysterious Valentines Day Card on February 14th to a Neopian who doesn't have the theme yet. See our Site Themes guide (http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=sitethemes#valentines) for full details.<br><br>
			To enable this new theme on redesigned pages, you need to choose it from the "Beta Theme" dropdown list on the <a href="/preferences.phtml">Site Preferences</a> page.<br><br><strong>2) A ticking clock has returned to the top right corner.</strong> A staple since the very first Neopets layout redesign has returned.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/TG2iQ4r.gif" style="width: 50%; padding: 10px;"></center>
					
			<br><strong>3) The Wheel of Monotony has been de-Flashed.</strong> And alongside the longest spinning wheel, all wheels now have sound effects added back in.<br><br><center>
					
			<a href="/prehistoric/monotony/monotony.phtml">Spin the Wheel of Monotony »</a></center>
					
			<br><br><strong>4) Last week, HTML5 Customisation closet fixes were pushed.</strong> If you haven't checked yet, see if you can now load your wearables to customise your Neopet. If you still have issues, TNT has stated they're still looking into remaining issues.<br><h6>Coming in a near-future release:</h6>
					
			<br><blockquote><ul><li>The Festival of Neggs site theme will be hopping onto mobile-friendly pages soon.</li>
					
			<li>HTML5 maps</li>
					
			<li>Mobile-friendly faerie quests</li>
					
			<li>Mobile-friendly updates to the HTML5 wheels</li>
					
			<li>Community Central</li>
					
			</ul></blockquote>
					
			<br><i>A member of TNT has also stated that if you're not a fan of the bright pink in this update's Valentine's Day theme, then sit tight... a sadder, greyer theme is also in the pipeline.</i>
		<h4>01.28 : inventory/ssw updates</h4>

					
			<b>A new update to the Neopets site redesign—v0.4.3—is now live! This update contains a handful of bug fixes:</b><br><br>

					
			1) Quick Stock and item transfer links added to Inventory page A sweet and simple update. The top right corner of the inventory page now contains two icons that link the Quick Stock and item transfer pages:<br><br>



					
			2) The Shop Wizard now contains a "Resubmit" button at the bottom to "refresh" the page. Now you can scroll to the bottom of the Shop Wizard results page to resubmit your search and get a new block of shops. Unfortunately, hitting the "Refresh" button in your browser does not actually refresh the results as you would expect.<br><img src="http://imgur.com/HvqVFrJ.gif" style="width: 90%; padding: 5%;">



					
			Both the Shop Wizard and Super Shop Wizard can have searches submitted by tapping the "Enter" key on your keyboard.<br><br>

					
			3) Multiple Neoboard Pens now react to the size of your device. Namely, before this update, if you had multiple Neoboard Pens, then they would fall off the side of the page on smaller devices (like smartphones) and prevent you from submitting a reply to a post.<br><br>

					
			The update also contains a number of other small fixes for site themes.<br><br>

					
			Coming in a near-future release:<br><br>

					
			A larger update with the following features will be released later this month:<br><br>

					
			HTML5 Premium Scratchcards<br>
			more converted Wheels<br>
			updates to the profile menu<br>
			a mobile-friendly "Winter Holiday" theme<br>
			and more!<br>
		<h4>12.27 : redesign updates and expectations</h4>
					
			<img src="https://imgur.com/FWRLMHh.gif" class="right" style="width:80px;padding: 2px; border: 2px solid white;">
					
			A new update to the Neopets site redesign&mdash;v0.4.2&mdash;is now live! This update contains a number of changes:<br>
			<br>
			<strong>1) Classic pages for redesigned features no longer available.</strong> If a page has been converted to the new Neopets layout in the past several, months, the old Classic version of the page is no longer available. For example, the National Neopian Bank is available in the new layout, and at this time is no longer available to view using the Classic Neopets Layout. In practice, this means the "Return to Classic" option in the new layout's menu is no longer available. Any page that still has not been converted, such as the Trading Post, will continue to live on in the Classic view until its turn.<br>
			<br>
			We understand that this is may be a frustrating change for some. It's likely happening because it gets <em>very</em> difficult maintaining two versions of the same website (and we can empathize with TNT there). This change was bound to happen at some point, and it's likely happening now given that a sizable chunk of pages are now living under the new layout.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2) Three of Neopia's wheels have been converted.</strong> The <a href="/faerieland/wheel.phtml">Wheel of Excitement</a>, <a href="/medieval/knowledge.phtml">Wheel of Knowledge</a>, and <a href="/prehistoric/mediocrity.phtml">Wheel of Mediocrity</a> have all been converted to be Flash-free, just ahead of the Flashpocalypse!  This also means you can access and spin these wheels from your mobile devices.<br><br>
			The other three wheels&mdash;Monotony, Misfortune, and Extravagance&mdash;are promised to be following soon.<br>
			
					
			<br>
			<strong>3) The NC Mall "Try On" feature is now Flash-free.</strong> A simple change, clicking "Try On" in the NC Mall should now use the HTML5 version of the customisation app. At time of writing, however, it's not fully working for us.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4) Classic pages for the Games Room and Customisation App remain.</strong> With the upcoming Flashpocalypse, these pages will not be useful for long, but if you can still run Flash, you can still access the Classic versions of Flash games and the Customisation Flash app.<br>
			<br>
			<center><a href="/games/classic.phtml" class="button">Classic Games Room &raquo;</a> <a href="/customise/classic.phtml" class="button">Classic Customisation &raquo;</a></center>
					
			<br>
			<strong>5) Score sending/NP rewards enabled for HTML5 games.</strong> Sending your score in the converted HTML5 games has been re-enabled. Score ratios will be adjusted as TNT looks at the data. (We're un-clear if there will still be a monthly score ratio update&mdash;stay tuned as we monitor.)<br>
			<br>
			<strong>6) The Pound doorways are Flash-free.</strong> The landing page for the <a href="/pound/">Neopian Pound</a> has also been updated to remove the Flash version of the three doors you click to get to Adopt, Transfer, or Abandon. A simple change that will be nice for the end of Flash.<br>
			<br>
			Coming in a near-future release:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>The Winter Holiday theme is coming next in a smaller content update in January. Create A Pet was going to be part of this release, but thanks to our changes to the rules recently, we decided to make some additional changes. The remaining wheels will also be coming ASAP, as well as a new Community Central hub page!</blockquote>
					
			<br>
			On a different note, with the forced retirement of Classic views for converted pages, one thing to be aware of is that Random Events currently <em>do not</em> work on the redesigned website. They simply have not been implemented yet. Since the forced change is live, we're hoping that TNT will consider porting over Random Events for the new site sooner, rather than later.<br>
			<br>
			<br><strong>Tired of the bright yellow site theme?</strong> Try changing your beta layout theme! There are multiple themes available right now:<br>
			<ul>
					
			<li>Neopets Basic</li>
					
			<li>Neopets Yellow</li>
					
			<li>Neopets Red</li>
					
			<li>Neopets Blue</li>
					
			<li>Neopets Green</li>
					
			<li>Neopets Purple</li>
					
			<li>Space Faerie Premium</li>
					
			<li>Altador Constellations (this one is nice and dark compared to "Basic")</li>
					
			<li>Haunted Woods</li>
					
			<li>Tis the Season</li>
					
			</ul>
					
			You may change it by clicking your Neopet in the top left corner of the site, then clicking on "Settings". (Or going directly to the <a href="/preferences.phtml">Settings page</a>.) Look for the "Beta Theme" dropdown menu and take your pick!<br>
			<br>
			Last heard from TNT, <em>all</em> site themes will be converted eventually. Next up, as seen above, is the Winter Holiday theme (unlockable via the Advent Calendar on December 31st if you've visited every day this year).
		<h4>12.24 : End of Flash TO-do List</h4>
					
			<img src="https://imgur.com/jHhZhfS.gif" class="right" style="width:80px;padding: 2px; border: 2px solid white;float:right;">
					
			As you may be aware, Flash is officially ending its run on the web on January 12, 2021. This is a hard stop that Adobe, the makers of Flash, have hardcoded into the Flash Player software that you use in your web browser.<br>
			<br>
			Before January 12th arrives, we wanted to get together a list of "to-do's" involving features in Neopia that still rely on Flash. You may want to complete the items on this list before January 12th, or else there may be consequences until TNT releases a Flash-free version of said feature. For example, we recommend scratching your Premium scratchcards before January 12th, as that feature relies on Flash and it is unknown when TNT will implement an HTML5 version of Premium scratchcards.<br>
			<br>
			Here's what we recommend:<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
					
			<li>Scratch all remaining <a href="/premium/sc/">Premium Scratchcards</a> you may have been awarded</li>
					
			<li>And likewise, scratch any <a href="/desert/sc/kiosk.phtml">Desert Scratchcards</a> you may wish to.</li>
					
			<li>Complete the <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/content/plot/index.php">Altador Mini-Plot</a> (the telescope portion uses Flash&mdash;if you already completed the plot, then you'll still be able to access the daily).</li>
					
			<li>Collect your worms in <a href="?go=tangorsworkshop">Moltara</a> (the Moltaran world maps are still Flash-based).</li>
					
			<li>Remove any furniture from inside or outside your <a href="/neohome/">Neohome 2.0</a>. (You can only remove an item from your Shed if it's not placed in your Neohome 2.0. Classic Neohomes can have items removed at any time, even without Flash working, so no issues there.)</li>
					
			<li>But speaking of Classic Neohomes, you should get the <a href="?go=avatars&s=classic+neohome">Robo</a> avatar if you don't have it already, as Classic Neohomes (and presumably the avatar for awhile) <em>will</em> be retiring.</li>
					
			<li>Use up any remaining <a href="http://ncmall.neopets.com/mall/shop.phtml?page=wonderclaw">Wonderclaw</a> and <a href="/mall/patapult/">Patapult</a> ticket packs you may have and wish to use before TNT revamps these features to be Flash-free.</li>
					
			<li>You may also want to use up any <a href="/halloween/nox_machine/">Corridor of Chance</a> keys you may have. The machine is Flash-free, but you do need to dress up your Neopet with items occupying specific zones in order to get the items you want, and that may be difficult until TNT converts all wearables to HTML5.</li>
					
			<li>Play a <a href="/games/">Flash-based game</a> to unlock any <a href="?go=avatars&id=games">secret avatars</a> before they become unavailable (until conversion). Or, play any of your favourites one final time before they are converted! (Visit the <a href="/halloween/gamegraveyard.phtml">Game Graveyard</a> to play a game that likely will not make it in the conversion.)</li>
					
			<li>Add <a href="/worlds/kiko/kpop/">Kiko Pop</a> to your dailies list for a shot at the avatar.</li>
					
			<li>Spin the <s>various Wheels of Neopia</s> Wheel of Misfortune, Extravagange, and/or Monotony to obtain each of their <a href="?go=avatars&s=wheel">secret avatars</a> you may still be missing. (As of 12/28/2020, the Wheels of Excitement, Mediocrity, and Knowledge are now Flash-free! TNT promises the remaining 3 wheels will come soon, so this to-do may not be that time sensitive.)</li>
					
			</ul>

			<br>
			We'd also like to take this time to get your questions! Anything worrying you about the Flash conversion? Ask away in the comments, and we can confirm whether Flash is needed or not. Something missing from our list above that other Neopians may want to use up before Flash dies? Let us know in the comments as well and we'll add it to the list!
		<h4>12.16 : Redesign Plans</h4>
					
			<ul>
					
			<li>Before the end of 2020, the ability to switch between "Classic" and "Beta" will be removed. You will only be able to see the newly redesigned versions of pages (such as the homepage, Neopian Bank, etc.). Any pages not converted to the new design yet will remain in Classic.</li>
					
			<li>Games&mdash;even the converted ones&mdash;will have their Flash Classic versions remain available for the time being.</li>
					
			<li>More games will be converted to HTML5 in 2021. Some may be updated to be freshened up (think Destruct-O-Match II and III). Some, which are not played at all, will not be converted. Outside contractors are helping TNT here to speed up the process.</li>
					
			<li>Game score submissions will return in the final 2020 update.</li>
					
			<li>About 75% of wearables have been converted from Flash, and they're hoping to be close to 100% by the end of 2020. (Most are converted via an automatic script, but some are troublesome that need to be completely redone from scratch and fixed by hand by artists.)</li>
					
			<li>The Customisation app is slated for more updates and bug fixes in early 2021.</li>
					
			<li>Any world maps that haven't been converted yet (most of them still), will have quick links added underneath. "Hidden" links won't be included, like the Hidden Tower in Faerieland. You will need to find these on your own in the meantime. Converting the rest of the maps are still TBD.</li>
					
			<li>The Neopian Pound doors (adopt, disown, transfer) will be updated to be links instead of a Flash animation.</li>
					
			<li>Later on, the Neopian Pound will also receive QoL updates and a redesign.</li>
					
			<li>Any dailies based on Flash will be brought over throughout 2021.</li>
					
			<li>Some things may be retired, but for the most part everything will come back.</li>
					
			<li>Neohomes&mdash;both Classic and 2.0&mdash;will probably be retired, and come back instead as a completely new "Neohomes 3.0" version. All the existing furniture items are hoping to remain usable in whatever the new Neohomes look like.</li>
					
			<li>The focus is always on pages/features/things that users use the most day to day.</li>
					
			<li>They also want to balance adding in some new features and content. Including "possibly some new plots" in 2021. (Lutari Island was also name dropped.)</li>
					
			<li>A redesigned Trading Post is ready for development resources to tackle in an upcoming update.</li>

		<div class="newspage" id="uc"><h4>unconverted pets new release</h4> 
					
			<p><img src="https://images.neopets.com/items/pot_uni_faerie.gif" class="right" style="width:80px;padding: 2px; border: 2px solid white;">	Earlier today (March 13th, 2021), a user let the cat out of the bag on an exploit cheaters have been using to generate, among other things, new Unconverted Pets. TNT are now actively investigating the issue and deleting/converting pets that have been found to have been created using the exploit. They have <a href="/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161015844">posted on the Official Neoboard</a> about the issue.<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote> Hey Neopians! <br>
			<br>
			As we're sure some of you are aware, a site issue has surfaced involving unconverted pets. Our team is aware of the situation and actively finding solutions for it. <br>
			<br>
			As a reminder, there are no official channels for the creation of new unconverted pets. Any pets directly tied to this recent issue that have been illegally unconverted will be returned to their original states once the issue is resolved. Additionally, any user found to be tampering with pet conversion in their own or other users' accounts will be banned and frozen. <br>
			<br>
			We've implemented a fix for the issue, and we'll be continuing to patch and monitor the situation over the next few days. We appreciate your patience as we get everything sorted out! <br>
			<br>
			(We're also aware of the high demand for unconverted pets, and have been looking into solutions to properly implementing them back into the game while keeping things fair for the existing community. We'll circle back with more news later this year!) <br>
			<br>
			-TNT</blockquote>
					
			<br>
			This is a marked departure from previous statements, which have always maintained UC pets would be too difficult to bring back in any form (though today’s exploit seems to illustrate that it perhaps wasn’t as complex after all). We’ll keep you informed of any updates.<br>
			<br>
			TNT Staff member Gutterfoot also briefly appeared on the r/neopets Discord to add a few things:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>we're so tired... but it really is happening, we've been talking about bringing back UCs for a while</blockquote>
					
			<br>
			In relation to giving 'old' UCs some form of identification:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>we did talk about doing something similar to what league does with their skins, so it's not out of the realm of possibility!</blockquote>
					
			<br>
			(This quote likely refers to League of Legends and the Chroma system it uses for palette swapped character skins, similar to how Dyeworks operates on Neopets. It is un-clear just how this would relate to UCs at this stage)

		<div class="newspage" id="merch"><h4>Merch Shop Opening</h4> 
					
			<p><img src="https://images.neopets.com/items/clo_feepit_tshirt.gif" class="right" style="width:80px;padding: 2px; border: 2px solid white;">As advertised in today's beta News notification and on the logged out front page, Neopets has now launched a new <a href="https://neopetsshop.com/">Merch Store</a>! This offers clothing, mugs, bottles, and stickers currently. These are new pieces of merch, distinct from those currently being offered by Hot Topic, Geekify, and WYP.<br><br>Note that the merch on offer at the store does not appear to come with any rare item codes, similar to Hot Topic. They are also not currently shipping outside of the United States.<br><br>To celebrate the opening, there is a special discount code you can apply to get a 15% saving on your order - <b>NEOPIAN15</b>. You can also subscribe to a merch email to get a second 15% discount on your next order through an additional code - <b>WELCOME15</b>. These two reductions do not stack. You do not actually have to sign up to the email in order to use the second reduction.<br><br>Additionally, Premium members have been sent a third code that will give an increased discount at 20% - <b>NEOPREMIUM20</b>. This code does not need an active premium membership to apply in the store, it can be used by anyone. Again, it does not stack with the other discounts. It is also limited time, expiring on May 31st (this Monday).

		<div class="newspage" id="lgbt"><h4>LGBTQ+ Discussion & Updates</h4>
					
			<img src="https://imgur.com/Hyw52cw.gif" class="right" style="width:80px;padding: 2px; border: 2px solid white;float:right;">

					
			The <a href="/ntimes/">Neopian Times Editorial</a> this week has included a big update on Neoboard filters and rules surrounding LGBTQIA+ topics. Up till now, talking about your gender identity has been blocked by filters or plainly against the rules if you found a way around the filtering.<br>
			<br>
			Starting now, that's no longer the case&mdash;but of course, there are some rules that go along with it. In general, as long as you continue to be kind to all your fellow Neopians, there really isn't too much else to keep in mind.<br>
			<br>
			Here is the announcement in full:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>Hey Neopians!<br>
			<br>
			We wanted to give you a heads up about some changes coming soon to the filters on the Neoboards. As many of you are aware, certain discussions that extend to real-life topics are not permitted on the boards, in order to ensure the safety and privacy of our users.<br>
			<br>
			However, Neopets should always be a safe place to express yourself, regardless of your identity or orientation, and many of the filters we had in place in the past did not allow for that expression. Above all else, it’s important to us on TNT that Neopia and the Neoboards are a safe and welcoming place for everyone, including Neopians in the LGBTQIA+ community. We've realized that some of the filters or restrictions placed on the Neoboards did not always account for that, so we’ll be making changes to filters surrounding LGBTQIA+ filters and topics on the Neoboards.<br>
			<br>
			It's always been a priority for TNT to support our userbase in expressing themselves openly and safely, and we are excited to roll out these long overdue changes! In doing so, we'd like to be very clear about what we can and cannot allow to keep Neopia safe, supportive and inclusive for all our users. Please look over our new rules below, which will be added to the Chat Rules page as well.<br>
			<br>
			1. Do not post about anyone else’s gender orientation or gender identity. This includes outing someone, pushing an identity or belief onto someone else, or recruiting others to join an off-site group or organization.<br>
			<br>
			2. Neopets has a wide userbase with many different personal beliefs and opinions. The Neoboards can be a place to express those beliefs, but not to discuss or debate them. In the event of an argument, we will have to flag all users involved, even if you believe you are in the right. If you are being harassed or discriminated against for your identity by another user on the boards, we ask that you not interact with them, and to report the issue to a moderator who will handle the situation.<br>
			<br>
			3. As a reminder, aligning yourself with a hate group is not an acceptable form of personal expression. Anyone who labels themselves as such or expresses hateful beliefs will be frozen.<br>
			<br>
			4. Coming out is absolutely fine! You’ll have a warm and accepting family of Neopians to welcome you! But please do not attempt to out someone else.<br>
			<br>
			5. You are free to use terminology such as “g-ay”, “straight”, “bi”, “qu-eer”, “cisgender”, “trans”, “questioning”, “les-bian”, and others to describe yourself. All we ask is that you use these terms in a positive way and not about another person.<br>
			<br>
			6. As with any form of harassment, we will not permit anyone to use these terms in an insulting way. If this does occur, the user in question will risk being warned and/or silenced.<br>
			<br>
			7. Relationship discussions are not permitted. Casually mentioning “My partner and I went out to see a film…” is not a problem at all! Going into even borderline/graphic intimate discussions is not allowed.<br>
			<br>
			8.Pride flag colours in your signatures are perfectly fine!<br>
			<br>
			We’re looking forward to having a more inclusive experience for everyone on the site! The moderation team has 21 years’ worth of filtered terms to sift through, so you can expect to see most LGBTQIA+ related filters lifted throughout the next few days. After that point, if you come across an LGBTQIA+ related term that you believe should be included, please submit an abuse report and the team will look into it.<br>
			<br>
			We’ll see you on the Neoboards!<br>
			<br>
			-TNT<br>

		<div class="newspage" id="flash"><h4>flash end of life solutions</h4>

					
			The Flash software offered by Adobe that runs along-side your browser to allow for interactive web experiences such as Neopets games has now ended. Adobe announced the Adobe Flash EOL for January 12th 2021. You'll find that most of Internet will not sympathize with our concerns bc Flash has always been terrible, a security risk and they did allow a three-year grace period... but none the less, here we are wanting our site features back as soon as possible. Neopians are leaving by the day so we've listed a less than desirable but yet very easy work-around and other more recommended options below. Please be sure to do your own research and choose the option best suited for you. <br><br><b>Flash Free Games:</b> <i>http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=links</i>
					
				

					
			<h4>recommended solutions</h4>

			<b>update!</b> The previous work-arounds are no longer acceptable to use as the client will not be receiving any more updates to protect you while using flash. However a new chrome script has been introduced by the name of Ruffle of which will enable many site features such as: <i>
			Altador Mini-Plot Star Mapping,    Double or Nothing Animation, 
			Coconut Shy,    Lair of the Beast Animation, 
			Lost Desert Scratchcards,    Apple Bobbing Animation, 
			Lunar Temple ,   Tarla's Non-Toolbar Treasures Animation, 
			Maps of Neopia,    Kiss the Mortog Animation, 
			Qasalan Expellibox,    The Lutari Talisman, 
			Test Your Strength,    Grarrl Keno Animation, 
			Turdle Racing,    The Neopian Lottery Animation, 
			Tutorial &  NeoQuest 1 & 2 Animations (however games are not included) </i><br><br><h6>More options</h6><ul>

			<li>Download the Puffin Browser :  It sucks, it's slow, and there are ads if you go with the free version (don't pay money for possible internet harm), but hey you can customize your UC pets and play Meerca Chase 2.</li>

					
			<li>Abode recommends using a solution from their Enterprise partner. This solution is a 'Chromium' browser bundled with electron.js and pepper api flash player and will cost you an annual license fee (and is limited to a single domain per license). -- The fact that this exists gives me hope for a permanent solution soon! (a free one...)<br><br>

					
			However, this is not the only solution for a less than desirable work-around or maybe one that's perfect for you! You can also inquire about emulators that will allow you to download and play flash content off-site (usually off-line as well) if you want to download your Neopets flash content to an archive - this is a great option for simply preserving flash content.</li></ul>

			<h4>risky options</h4><i>Be aware of the risks that come with enabling Adobe Flash post-EOL as enabling outdated software could make your computer vulnerable to a variety of unwanted dangers such as security risks, malware, and more. It is NOT safe and we are NOT responsible for any dangers that may occur from enabling Adobe Flash post-EOL.</i><br><br>
			<strong>Enabling on Windows</strong><i> (Pale Moon, Waterfox)</i>
			<h6>Pale Moon :</h6><ul> <li>

			Install Pale Moon</li><li>

			Uninstall Flash if you already have any version installed.</li><li>

			Download 32.0.0.XXX version of Flash.</li><li>

			Disconnect your computer from the internet to install Flash.</li><li>

			Set Flash to not automatically update.</li><li>

			Restart (close/reopen) the browser and enjoy the site.</li></ul>



			<h6>Waterfox</h6><ul>

			<li> Install Waterfox

			</li><li>Uninstall Flash if you already have any version installed.

			</li><li>Download 32.0.0.XXX version of Flash.

			</li><li>Disconnect your computer from the internet to install Flash.

			</li><li>Set Flash to not automatically update.

			</li><li>Restart (close/reopen) the browser and enjoy the site.</li></ul>


			<h4>Q&A</h4><ul>
			<b>Q:</b> Is it safe to enable Flash post-EOL?<br>

			<b>A:</b> NO, IT IS NOT SAFE, but due to the popularity of running Flash post-EOL to run certain Neopets features (i.e. Flash Games and Customization), it's become a common request for people to take their chances with the danger.<br><br>

			<b>Q:</b> Is it against the rules to run Flash post-EOL to play Flash Games?<br>

			<b>A:</b> It is NOT recommended due to the safety risks, but you are allowed to run Flash post-EOL to play Neopets Flash Games assuming you're not cheating with the workaround (See Neopian Times, Issue 927).<br>

			Also, you are NOT allowed to submit scores for the same Flash Game and Beta Game within the same day (See Neopian Times, Issue 924).<br><br>

			<b>Q:</b> What is the best browser/method to run Flash with?<br>

			<b>A:</b> There is no best browser/method to run Flash with, they're all equally dangerous in their own way. As for safety, you'd want to either use a Virtual Machine or run a separate computer.<br><br>

			<b>Q:</b> Can I use X browser/method to enable Flash instead?<br>

			<b>A:</b> There are many browsers/methods you can run Flash on, but for the sake of brevity, we will be covering Pale Moon, Waterfox, and Puffin. Here is a list of alternative browsers/methods that have been successful with Neopians:<br>

			Virtual Machine (Works with Windows & Mac and is safer than all mentioned, but is storage heavy and complicated to comprehend/teach)<br>

			Basilisk Portable (Works with Windows)<br>

			Cent Browser (Works with Windows)<br>

			Firefox ESR (Works with Windows & Mac, but might not work with certain recommended versions and also don't use it if you use the regular Firefox browser often)<br>

			Puffin Desktop Browser (Works with Windows & Mac, but it costs money so nty glt)<br><br>

			<b>Q:</b> Should I use these browsers to browse other websites?<br>

			<b>A:</b> No. If you are going to enable Flash for Neopets, only use it for Neopets (not even for Neopets certified Fansites).<br><br>

			<b>Q:</b> Do I have to run Flash to finish the Altador Mini-Plot?<br>

			<b>A:</b> Fortunately, you do not, but you would have to download the Ruffle extension (don't worry it's safe to use and the instructions to download are provided on the page).</ul><br><br><i>Brought to you by r/n, fruit_loopia</i>

		<h5>12.07.21 | Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker | PS4/5, XB, Mac/PC</h5>
				<img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_box_art/public/2021/08/09/b58c8cc0/ffxivendwalker.jpg" class="gameimage" style="float: left;"><h6>about</h6>	This year's Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival may not have been the joyous gathering of fans that it has been in years past, but the move from an in-person event to a digital livestream still delivered plenty of surprises and excitement. The focus was intently on the forthcoming Endwalker expansion pack, which was announced to have a November 23 release date. (Now December 7th)<br><br>Final Fantasy XIV’s 24 million registered players weave a tale of hard-fought success considering the original game’s shaky release before the reupholstered A Realm Reborn launch. Since then, Eorzea has grown with multiple expansions: Heavensward, Stormblood, and Shadowbringers, each introducing new areas to explore, more character jobs, and exciting story beats to bolster the already compelling central narrative. Endwalker is the next large-scale addition. The pandemic affected the fourth expansion’s production, and now producer and director Naoki Yoshida has announced a short two-week delay.<br><br>Endwalker is brimming with most of the feature sets and additions you'd expect from an expansion of this ilk. The level cap is increasing from 80 to 90, which will be put to good use in new dungeons and raids, and there are plenty of new bosses to face, including Anima and the Magus Sisters. Numerous new features have also including but not limited to new role quests for tanks, healers, melee DPS, physical ranged DPS, magical ranged DPS, Reaper, and Sage classes, new raids with Normal and Savage difficulty settings set for later patches, another treasure hunt dungeon and housing area with bigger purchasable plots, 5v5 PVP with ranked seasons, and small-scale quality of life tweaks including UI changes.

		<h5>11.05.21 | Animal Crossing DLC & Updates </h5>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/edu1zLU.gif" class="gameimage" style="float: left;"><h6>about</h6>As previously mentioned, Animal Crossing: New Horizons' version 2.0 update will see the long-awaited arrival of Brewster and his coffee shop The Roost. This new shop is part of the museum and will let players enjoy fresh-brewed coffee alone or with some friends. The villagers on your island will come to the shop as well, and you can invite specific villagers via amiibo cards or figures.<br><br>

				Long-time fans of Animal Crossing will be happy to know that Brewster isn't the only returning villager who is part of this update, as it will also see such others as Kapp'n, Katrina, Tortimer, Harriet, Wardell, and more make their way to New Horizons.<br><br>

				Kapp'n and his beautiful voice will invite you on his boat for a journey to various new and mysterious islands that only he knows of. Each could have a different season, time of day, or weather than your own island, and many will have "mysterious flora" and other surprises.
				<br><br>
				As for the other villagers, these wonderful animals will be found on Harv's Island, which is also getting a big upgrade. His island will be the home to a new plaza that features all sorts of shops waiting to be built with the right amount of Bells. Once built, familiar merchants like Sahara, Kicks, Reese, and Cyrus will open up a new place to do business alongside returning favorites like Katrina and her fortune shop, Harriet and her hair-styling shop (with new hair styles!), and Tortimer and his storage solution.
				<br><br>
				Your Island will also get some new activities like Group Stretching at the plaza. This is an activity you can do with your fellow villagers or friends, and the stretching can be done with buttons or by using motion controls.
				<br><br>
				Island Ordinances are also being added, and they will let you enact such changes to your island like keeping shops open later or increasing the number of Bells you receive when selling items. The full list of ordinances includes the Beautiful Island Ordinance, Early Bird Ordinance, Night Owl Ordinance, and Bell Boom Ordinance.
				<br><br>
				Players will also be able to change the exterior look of their home, home storage has been expanded from 2,400 to 5,000, and lighting and ceiling decor can now be added to house interiors with a new Pro Decorating License. Nine new fence options are being added, players can add two more bridges or inclines to their island, and ABDs (Animal Crossing's ATMs) and storage sheds can be placed most anywhere on an island to give easy access to Bells and your items.
				<br><br>
				Those who love cooking are in for a treat as players will be able to combine ingredients to make meals like Minestrone or Pizza to display on any table or serve at a feast. Ingredients like tomatoes, wheat, sugarcane, potatoes, and carrots can also be grown to use in recipes!
				<br><br>
				Gyroids are another big addition in version 2.0 and can now be found on player's islands. Players will be able to find Gyroid fragments underground and, when planted and watered, they will turn into a Gyroid overnight. There are many types of Gyroids and many come with a unique look, sound, and animation. They can also be customized.
				<br><br>
				Other updates include an update to the Pro Camera App that lets players take photos from eye-level view, 11 new reactions, 12 more songs from K.K. Slider, new permanent ladder kits to place around the island, the ability to navigate tight spaces in your home, the apparent addition of Froggy Chair (!), and much more.
				<br><br>
				Animal Crossing: New Horizons' version 2.0 update will be the final major free update for the game that was released in March 2020.

				<h4>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Happy Home Paradise Paid DLC</h4><img src="https://imgur.com/sulozvQ.gif" class="gameimage" style="float: right;"><b> Lets You Build Villager's Dream Homes!</b><br>
				Alongside Animal Crossing: New Horizon's version 2.0 update, November 5 will also see the release of the paid Happy Home Paradise DLC for players who wish to spend $24.99 USD or who are subscribed to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.
				<br><br>
				Happy Home Paradise can be accessed by flying from the island's airport to a new archipelago that is the home to Paradise Planning. This company's mission is to build the dream vacation homes for villagers around the world and they need your help.
				<br><br>
				There will be characters on the island that will have various requests, including one who loves mushrooms, another who loves arcades, and yet another who loves teddy bears. Once you accept a request, you will be able to pick an island that suits their style, and can pick the weather, time of day, and season to also help fit the mood.
				<br><br>
				There will be designated furniture and items that need to be used, but an ever-expanding catalog of items will also be available to help complete the home's interior and exterior. The homes can be moved around, trees, fencing, and paths can be added to the yard, lighting and accent walls can be added, and much more.
				<br><br>
				As you complete more and more requests, you will unlock more techniques that will let you improve your designs. These include different colored lighting, the ability to modify a home's width of length, the use of partition walls, the option to add pillars that support the ceiling and counters with different heights, soundscapes, and furniture polishing. Polishing will add certain effects to furniture like sparkling stars or flying butterflies.
				<br><br>
				As you learn these new techniques, you will be able to revisit old homes you've worked on to remodel them and utilize any sk1lls you've unlocked.
				<br><br>
				You will also be compensated for your work in Happy Home Paradise with Poki. This currency can be traded in for rare items that can only be found on this archipelago but can be brought home with you. Speaking of home, all the techniques you've learned - except for expanding the size of houses or rooms - can be used on your own home. Furthermore, the ability to remodel your neighbors' houses can also be unlocked. If you wish, you can even design a dream home for one of your favorite neighbors on the archipelago.
				<br><br>
				amiibo figures and cards can be used to invite clients of your choosing to Paradise Planning so you can build their dream homes as well. This means you can design homes for Isabelle, Timmy and Tommy, and many more. Speaking of amiibo cards, Animal Crossing Series 5 amiibo cards will also be launching on November 5 with 48 characters total. These cards also give a glimpse at some of the new Villagers that will be joining Animal Crossing: New Horizons and will be available to live on your Island.
				<br><br>
				That's not all, however, as the island Paradise Planning is located on has various facilities that are just waiting to be designed. This means you can also design your own school, hospital, restaurant, and more.
				<br><br>
				Everything you design will be recorded in the new Happy Home Network App on your NookPhone. From there, you can keep track of what you've done, share your work with others, or follow other creators for inspiration.
				<br><br>
				If you aren't ready to purchase Happy Home Paradise, friends are able to gift items acquired on the new archipelago to those who don't have the DLC. Also, many of the new techniques that are featured in Happy Home Paradise, including adding ceiling decor, lighting, accent walls, and using patterns for flooring and wallpaper are available to all as part of the Version 2.0 update.

				<h4>The Beginning of the End for Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h4><img src="https://imgur.com/gljFwJS.gif" class="gameimage" style="float: left;">
				While Animal Crossing: New Horizons will continue to live on for many years to come with its seasonal events and the ever-evolving lives of the player and the villagers who call the island home, Nintendo has no more plans to add anything major to the game following the version 2.0 update and the Happy Home Paradise paid DLC.
				<br><br>
				Happy Home Paradise! will be the first and only paid DLC expansion for the game and will hopefully add countless hours of enjoyment for the latest entry in the long-running franchise that has sold over 33 million units since its launch in 2020.
				<br><br>
				Since then, Animal Crossing fans have participated in the infamous Bunny Day event, have seen the addition of ocean swimming, Dream Islands, fireworks, Mario-themed items, and so much more.
				<br><br>
				It will also forever be remembered as a game that helped many through the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic by giving them an opportunity to hang out with friends and loved ones while quarantined from the actual world.
				<br><br>
				If all of these updates sound like something you'd like to try and you have or are planning on purchasing the Nintendo Switch - OLED Model, be sure to check out our guide so you can safely transfer your Island and all its data to your new system. <i>Brought to you by Adam Bankhurst, IGN)</i>



				

		<h5>11.19.21 | Pokémon Brilliant Diamond/Pearl | Switch </h5>
				<img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_box_art/public/2021/07/06/8bf12a9d/pokemondiamond.jpg" class="gameimage" style="float: left;"><h6>about</h6>Upcoming remakes to the first Nintendo DS Pokémon games, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl from ILCA are two of the biggest releases set for Nintendo’s holiday lineup. With just over a month until their expected release on November 19, we were allowed to go eyes-on the games in a preview event. We got a glimpse at what’s staying the same in these updated games and which modern conveniences are added to the Sinnoh adventure.<br><br>

				Our demonstration began with a look at the world, which remains faithful to the vision of the original Diamond and Pearl. The camera remains overhead, and the characters populating Sinnoh are presented in chibi models. However, everything has been remade with 3D models, with new textures and all, which we had known since the initial trailer some months ago. What is new about wandering the routes from town to town is the option to let one of your Pokémon companions stroll behind you at all times. It’s a cool feature from Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee and the Sword and Shield Isle of Armor DLC that I’m very happy to see return.		<br><br>If you want more Pokémon from your party out and about, head to Amity Square. It’s a location that allows predetermined “cute” Pokémon to spread out around the park, causing a sort of hide-and-seek game to play out. Your monsters will find items around the area, and as you find each one, they’ll begin to follow you wherever you roam in Amity Square. With more than one member of your party at your side, the developers allow you to have a little bit of fun by adding a zoom function to the in-game camera so you can snap pictures with your partners. Bring all of your favorites (deemed cute by the Amity Square front desk attendant, of course) and make some memories.<br><br>

				Speaking of cute, the Pokémon Super Contest Shows return as well. Super Contests are a way to compete in different categories, including Cuteness, Toughness, Coolness, and more. You’ll play a simple rhythm game during the competitions and try to unleash a pre-chosen move from your Pokémon at the perfect time to wow the judges. You’ll also be able to see the fruits of your b4ll Capsule customization. With b4ll Capsules, you can add stickers to specific Pokéb4lls, creating unique animations and flourishes whenever you bring that Pokémon out. I saw a combination of flames and water effects applied to one of the Pokémon our demoist brought out. Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will have over 90 of these stickers, and some can be earned by winning the Super Contest Shows.<br><br>

				<img src="https://imgur.com/g9jxN5s.gif" class="gameimage" style="float: right;">Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl aren’t going to be completely faithful to the originals, as the remakes are bringing in some well-tested features from the most recent mainline games. First, Pokémon battles use the full 3D models you’d expect to see in Sword and Shield. Your trainer is also given a full-sized model so that you can show off your character’s outfits in battle. EXP Share is applied to all Pokémon in your party when a battle concludes. However, it was confirmed that it’s not a feature that can be turned off this time around. Other quality of life additions like autosaves and seeing move effectiveness on your attacks also return.
				<br><br>
				A big question going into these remakes was whether Hidden Machines made the cut since they’re in a very different state in the modern Pokémon games. This time around, winning Gym badges will unlock HM moves that can be used in the world, but you do not have to teach them to your Pokémon. Using an HM like Strength to move a boulder will make a wild Pokémon appear and use the move for you. It doesn’t really make sense, but I’ll take the convenience over wasting precious move slots. You can call on these helpful wild monsters using the new and improved Pokétch, the watch-like device from Diamond and Pearl, which is now more like a modern smartwa.tch. Apps on this new Pokétch include a step counter, Pokémon friend checker, a calculator, an item dowsing machine, and a drawing pad.	((John Carson, GameInformer))

Unfortunately, the first Super Monkey b4ll remaster came in the form of 2019's Super Monkey b4ll: Banana Blitz HD, a re-release of one of the less popular entries in the series.

		<h5>10.15.21 | Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba | (PS5, XB-X/S, PS4, XB-1, SW, PC) </h5>
			<img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2021/04/26/2fd77a4f/demonslayer.jpg" class="gameimage" style="float: left;"><h6>about</h6><i>Demon Slayer: The Video Game is being developed by CyberConnect2, the studio behind the prolific Naruto fighting game franchise and Dragonb4ll Z: Kakarot. If you take a look at the gameplay footage above, you can get a better understanding of how in-game battles will play out. A tag battle mode is also being planned, where you’ll be able to compete against the AI or other players using various character combinations. The classic Ultimate Ninja Storm formula is on display – choose a character and select an arena to fight in. Flashy combos and swift evasion mechanics that employ the beautiful art style from the anime help give the game its extra visual flair. And, of course, there are some pretty cool finisher cinematics too; Nezuko’s is particularly impressive. <br><br>But what of the story, and how will it fit into the expansive Demon Slayer universe? A single player campaign has been confirmed and will primarily follow the events from the first season. This means that you’ll be able to relive some of the series’ most tantalizing conflicts - from the Tsuzumi Mansion arc to Tanjiro’s fateful encounter with Rui. While I was hoping for an enticing sandbox to roam around in (a guy’s gotta dream, right?), I am excited to see how the anime/manga story beats transfer over. <br><br>A lesser-known “asymmetrical survival action game” for mobile devices called Demon Slayer: Blood-Stench Blade Royale was also delayed indefinitely to give the dev team (completely separate from CyberConnect2) more time to polish the project. Details surrounding this title are scarce, but the fact that Demon Slayer will be soon be playable on the small and big screen is testament to its relevance.	((JASON GUISAO, GAMEINFORMER))	</i><br><br><b>The Hinokami Chronicles is a spectacular arena fighter from the team at CyberConnect2 that lets players relive the memorable moments of “Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc” and “Mugen Train Arc”. Follow Tanjiro through the story from the “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba” anime as he faces demons in order to turn his sister Nezuko, who has become a demon, back into a human. Players can expect: • Exhilarating Arena Battles – Master the multitude of spectacular sk1lls of a wide roster of characters from the anime, including Tanjiro and Nezuko, to overcome challengers in head - to - head battle, locally and online. • Moving Drama – Take up the sword of Tanjiro Kamado and guide his journey to become a Demon Slayer and turn his sister Nezuko back into a human. • Thrilling Boss Battles – Action and drama reach their peak in specially designed battles against powerful demons that will test Tanjiro's mettle. • Original Anime Voice Cast – The original English and Japanese casts of the anime return to bring their authentic portrayals to the game.</b>

The rock ’n roll attitude. Groot being Groot. Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy looks to be every bit as fun and wild as the motion picture and comic book counterparts. We all thought it would be a multiplayer game when it was announced, but Eidos-Montréal’s decision to make it a single-player experience that puts you into the head of Star-Lord makes it all the more intriguing. As the leader of the team, you are tasked to make difficult decisions that affect both the story and your standing with the Guardians in big ways. I can’t wait to see how those choices play out. The combat also looks as chaotic as I’d hoped with razor-sharp melee strikes blending with death being rained down by heavy, sci-fi weaponry. Every aspect of the game looks joyous and crazy and that’s exactly what I want from this awesome superhero team.	<br><br>	You are Star-Lord, so nothing’s off-limits with your bold combat style, from Element Blasters and jet boot-powered dropkicks to tag-team beat-downs.

		<h5>09.30.21 | Astria Ascending </h5>
					
			<img src="https://imgur.com/hAu3JtM.gif" class="gameimage" style="float: left;"><h6>about</h6>Astria Ascending caught our attention when it was unveiled in March for its gorgeous hand-drawn visuals. French-Canadian developer Artisan Studios, who created the Super Neptunia RPG, enlisted plenty of JRPG talent to help them create the game.

				
			The story is written by Kazushige Nojima, best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series, spanning from VII all the way to today with XV and VII Remake. Composer Hitoshi Sakimoto, who provided memorable scores for Final Fantasy XII, Vagrant Story, and Valkyria Chronicles, is behind the music. While the art comes from Akihiko Yoshida, the main character designer on  Nier: Automata and Bravely Default, and Hideo Minaba, who was a primary art lead on Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy’s IX and XIV. 

				
			The RPG’s beauty and exciting talent speak for themselves, but how does it play? With just about a month out from launch, Alex Stadnik and I recently went hands-on with the game to find out, playing through its first few hours. It's certainly taking plenty of cues from Square Enix's Bravely Default series, putting an emphasis on using your turns wisely, maximizing the potential of your party members’ job abilities, and having elemental strengths and weaknesses integral to your success.

But what if another world exists behind the one we see? What if a second reality sits just behind the façade of our experiences? And, what if this reality is full of spirits we cannot see and cannot touch, who brush past us on a daily basis? Bloober Team attempts to explore this mysterious spirit realm with its puzzle-filled horror adventure, The Medium. Sadly, Bloober Team’s vision for an unseen reality isn’t that exciting to look at.<br><br>Marianne is a supernatural medium who can talk to the dead, but when she receives a mysterious phone call summoning her to a derelict hotel on the outskirts of Kraków, Poland, her talents are truly tested. When Marianne arrives at the resort, the only inhabitants she encounters are tormented lost souls and an invisible monster who forces Marianne to wrestle with her past. The Medium’s narrative starts with a lot of promise, but quickly loses steam. Marianne doesn’t have much of a personality, and is little more than a cipher to move the plot along. Moreover, certain details are hard to follow, and The Medium's few interesting twists (near the end of the game) feel unearned. <i> (Ben Reeves, GameInformer // Rated 6.5/10)</i><ul>

		<h5>09.10.21 | Lost in Random | PS4, Xbox One, PC </h5>
					
			<img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2021/07/22/fae666c9/lost_in_random_ea_play_2021_screen_2.jpg" class="gameimage" style="float: left;"><h6>about</h6>Lost in Random by Zoink, the makers of Fe, is a promising-looking EA Originals title we’ve been waiting to get our hands on since it was announced last summer. Today’s EA Play presentation treated us to a new gameplay breakdown of the game’s unique combat and also finally pulled the curtain back on a release date. <br><br>
				
			On September 10, you can guide a young girl named Even on a quest to rescue her captive sister, Odd. She’s joined by Dicey, a living dice, as they explore the Kingdom of Random. An evil queen reigns over this dark fairytale world, which is divided into six realms governed by a cursed black dice. <br><br>
				
			At its core, Lost in Random is a third-person action-adventure title but combat takes the form of flashy dice battles that unfold in board game-like arenas. By collecting coins, players can trade them to purchase cards that grant new attacks, abilities, and more. For example, one card causes Dicey to explode on contact with enemies. Another card transforms him into a giant hammer. Other cards can afflict enemies with curses and spawn traps in the environment.<br><br>
				
			 Even herself can drop baddies using a slingshot. She can also knock off energy cubes that fuel Dicey. When Dicey’s at full power, he can unleash a time-freezing spell that brings enemies to a halt, giving you a temporary window to unleash the power of randomness.<br><br>
				
			Lost in Random’s Tim Burton-esque vibe combined with its unique tactical combat has all the potential of a gem in the making. It was recently honored as part of the Tribeca Film Festival’s first official games selection, so it’s already doing something right. We’ll find out once we get our hands on it when it launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. <br><br>

				
			<h6>A Twisted Fairytale</h6>	<i>Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Random, there lived a mad Queen who controlled a mysterious black dice. By her decree, every child of Random would be given the honor of rolling the dice on their twelfth birthday to determine which realm of the kingdom they belonged to, thereby deciding their fate for all eternity. Roll a one and the child would be sent to Onecroft, destined to live a life of struggle. Roll a three and land in Threedom, a chaotic realm destroyed by civil war. Roll a six, and they would live a life of luxury in the Queen’s dark palace. Or so it was told…	<br><br>	One day, two devoted sisters from Onecroft named Even and Odd, were cruelly separated by a throw of the dice. For on Odd’s twelfth birthday, she rolled a six. How marvelous! Despite this seemingly fortuitous news, Even was heartbroken at the loss of her sister.<br><br>Just one year after her sister was taken, Even received a strange signal. Was Odd in danger? Determined to find out, she followed the signal to a mysterious place – the Valley of Dice.<br><br>There, Even discovered something that had been forbidden to the citizens of Random for as long as time could remember – a living, breathing dice. Despite the danger of being caught with such a companion, Even decided to make the charming creature her own, naming him Dicey.<br><br>But, to Even’s surprise, beneath Dicey’s gentle exterior was the power to alter the world around them and even time itself, triggering a fantastical adventure that would take them across all six realms of Random. Along the way they would meet many strange citizens, embark on courageous quests, and battle disturbing enemies in their mission to uncover a dark and twisted secret.</i>

Through a seemingly limitless array of character interactions and plot progression, Hades seeds its storytelling over many hours of repeated runs, as you lead your character along one attempted escape from hell to the next. In addition to weapon and character upgrades, new story insights are among the most satisfying rewards. But that also means that you’ll be eager to see those plot threads resolve, and to do that, you should prepare for an especially long road.<br><br>Zagreus is the son of mighty Hades, who rules the realm of the dead with a barely controlled anger only matched by his insistence on total control. He’s the definition of an overbearing father, and Zagreus’ desire to strike out on his own feels as much like a family drama as the retelling of a familiar mythology. His quest to find a mother he’s never known brings him into contact with a who’s who of Olympus and the Greek ancient world, including Zeus, Athena, Achilles, and Medusa. The constantly shifting dynamics between these characters makes for great fun, from the sibling rivalry among the Olympians to reconnecting old flames like Orpheus and Eurydice, and I love the way story tidbits creep in both between action sequences and during them.<br><br>Each escape attempt encompasses a series of isometric arena battles, assaulting an impressive variety of enemies in throwdowns that demand precision and careful observation. The combat is fast-paced and challenging, nodding more to stylish action games like Devil May Cry than the isometric RPGs it might look like at first glance. The sense of adrenaline is always high, but there’s also a potential for encounters to devolve into frantic button mashing as you spam out every available attack to bring foes down before they can unleash their worst counters.<br><br>New weapons unlock regularly, and they can dramatically change your playstyle, from the precision of the Heart-Seeking Bow to the furious melee dominance of the Twin Fists of Malphon. The most impressive design feat is how even the same weapon inevitably feels different on each run, as god-gifted boons alter and enhance individual armaments, spells, and other abilities.<br><br>The story is stretched across too many hours of play to maintain excitement throughout, but there’s absolutely a rich bounty of content to uncover along the way. Hades is a massive game, with a wealth of additional content to appease even the most hardcore of engagement. A “god mode” offers a gradual increase in damage resistance after each death, putting victory in reach for even those with a cap on their abilities. On the other hand, risk-takers looking for more rewards can eventually access a way to increase the difficulty. Alternate boss fights, new weapon aspects, hidden storylines, and plenty more invite the player to get lost in Hades’ potential. These variants and additional options provide life to the game, long after the charm of standard completion attempts begins to wear out. <br><br>Even serious engagement doesn't ensure story completion without many hours of investment, and only the most dedicated players will see the full spread of what Hades has to offer. But Supergiant’s latest opus is a beautiful and thoughtful twist on Greek mythology, flipping these old stories on their head and transforming them into commentaries on modern relationships. High-octane action gameplay may pull you into hell for the first time, but I suspect you’ll stay to find out about this eccentric and fascinating family.

The Zelda-inspired adventure with Studio Ghibli visuals is launching August 27. <br><br>The adventure stars Baldo, an cheerful young lad who embarks on a grand adventure revolving around an ancient prophecy. Along the way players interact with a cast as colorful as the game’s vibrant open world itself. Gameplay consists of third-person combat, puzzle-solving, and dungeon crawling in the style of classic 3D Zelda. In a 2019 interview with Red Bull, Baldo creator and artist Fabio Capone said the game "It isn't focused on combat mainly, although that's a big part of it, but it will share a lot of elements from the Zelda series. At its core Baldo is a puzzle and dungeon game, although there are plenty of other secrets inside."		<br><br>Baldo comes courtesy of Italian studio Naps Team. Capone is a big fan of Studio Ghibli’s work (namely Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, and Mary and the Witch’s Flower), and Baldo began as a passion project fueled by a desire to create a game that captured the whimsical tone and presentation of those films. The project has been in development in some form or another for the last 15 years, making today’s announcement the light at the end of a very long tunnel for Capone and his team.

New World has changed its vision multiple times over the course of development, and now the question on everyone’s mind is – where is this going to land on release? What kind of player is it for? What kind of MMORPG is it? And perhaps the most important question, is it worth your time at all? Over the course of the beta (and a demo session that took me into an endgame slice with a fully-geared character), I’ve seen some areas with huge potential that are currently underserved in the MMORPG space – and some others that could be intense detriments for the title. Let’s talk about New World!	<br><br><h6>world</h6>For thousands of years the mysterious island of Aeternum has been the source of fantastical legends—and now you’ve found it. Shipwrecked, with no supplies or allies, you’ll need to make your way in a dangerous world where the fundamental laws of life and death don’t apply.<br><br>Magic flows through Aeternum. It brings life: miraculous healing, reanimation of the dead, and strange flora with magical properties. And it brings horror: the power to cause untold destruction and the slow wasting of the soul through countless cycles of death and resurrection.<br><br>In such a land, your destiny is whatever you make of it.<ul><LI>As you journey, you'll find creatures, plants, stones, and other resources that have been altered by the magic of Aeternum. Most important is the precious Azoth, a strange blue substance that seems to be magic given form.</LI><LI>Wretched once-human creatures, twisted by centuries of death and revival, infest Aeternum—the Corrupted, the Ancient, and the Lost. They and the Angry Earth, strange beings that seem more plant than animal, each have their own plans for the island and its magic.</LI><li>Aeternum's mysteries run as deep and dark as its history. Delve into the world and uncover the secret truth of the island and its millennia of strange inhabitants.</li></ul><h6>Progression</h6>From tattered rags to powerful hero, you'll grow in might, ability, and influence you adventure in Aeternum.<br><br>When and how you progress is up to you: each gathered plant, tanned hide, slain foe, or completed quest will make you better at the particular ability or weapon you're using and will also contribute to your overall character level.<br><br><h6>social exp</h6>At the core of the social side of New World are the three factions, organizations of like-minded players and non-player characters with their own motives and schemes for the island's future. Within each faction, players can form or join groups called companies. Your faction choice will determine who you fight with and against in PvP and can confer benefits if your faction or company controls settlements and territories.<ul><strong>THE MARAUDERS</strong><br> Living examples of the credo "might makes right," the Marauders are a ruthless military force bent on establishing a free nation where anyone with the strength and determination to stake a claim can do so.<br><br><strong>THE SYNDICATE</strong> <br>Working in the shadows and dealing with secrets, members of the Syndicate use their boundless guile and intellect in pursuit of forbidden knowledge.<br><br><strong>THE COVENANT</strong> <br>Divine champions who are driven by conviction and their faith in the light of the Spark, the Covenant fights with righteousness and justice for the struggling souls of all living things.</ul>

It stars two noble-born siblings, Amicia and Hugo de Rune, on a search for a cure for the latter’s mysterious illness. After suffering a family tragedy, their journey takes them across 14th century France which is currently overrun by a supernatural swarm of ravenous rats spreading the black plague. If that’s not bad enough, the kids are also being hunted by the French Inquisition. <br><br>The game is best described as a stealth adventure game, with players largely evading or distracting soldiers, though a few combat scenarios are present. Rats, on the other hand, are sensitive to light and many puzzles involve using torches and other light sources to repel floods of them. That's because these cursed critters can devour creatures in an instant. (Marcus Stewart / Game Infomer)<br>

			Take advantage of the newly-added button only control scheme—perfect for playing in handheld mode or on the Nintendo Switch Lite system.</li><br><br><h6>review</h6>One interesting note about the rerelease is that Skyward Sword's control scheme has been remade for the Nintendo Switch. Originally, the game used the motion-based Wii Remote and Nunchuk to imitate Link's sword and shield, respectively. Now, as detailed by series producer Eiji Aonuma, the Switch's Joy-Cons will operate in a similar manner. According to Aonuma, on Switch, the controls should be smoother and "more intuitive" than they were on the original Wii release. Button controls were also announced for the game, meaning that for the first time, Skyward Sword can also be played in handheld mode or while docked. To celebrate the occasion, Nintendo also announced a pair of custom Joy-Cons, themed after Skyward Sword. The Joy-Cons are expected to release alongside the HD version of the game on July 16.

The new fantasy action title is the studio’s first major release since 2015’s Titan Souls, and it’s coming later this year. <br><br>In Death’s Door, players control a crow whose job is to collect the souls of the dead. Your normal day-to-day routine takes a turn for the worst when your assigned soul is stolen by a mysterious thief, and it’s up to you to track it down. The adventure takes you into a strange realm where creatures live far beyond their lifespans and death seemingly has no sway. The reveal trailer below shows off the whimsical environments (such as your striking black and white headquarters) and fast-paced combat. 		<br><br>	The design shares some DNA with series like The Legend of Zelda as players cut down foes with their trust sword as well as other weapons they’ll acquire along the way, such as a bow and arrow. The crow also boasts some magical abilities. Weapons and magic can be upgraded to into more powerful forms. The game also has a bit of Metroid in that certain areas will be inaccessible without a certain item or ability. The large overworld is filled with secrets, weird characters, and no shortage of large-scale boss fights.  <br><br>Death’s Door stands as Acid Nerve’s biggest game yet. While Titan Souls could be completed in a handful of hours, the developers told Game Informer that they envision Death’s Door to take around 10. From the beautiful presentation and unique premises to the hack and slash combat, the game looks like it's shaping up to be a neat action-adventure romp we're itching to get our hands on.

The stack of corpses Resurrection piled up during my playthrough made me swear like a sailor, and yet I walked away singing its praises as one of the best throwbacks I’ve ever played.<br><br>Legendary hero Arthur and his more famous pair of boxer shorts return to be lit on fire, knocked into pits, and munched by a cave made of teeth, much to the chagrin of the player and delight of Capcom’s designers (which is spearheaded by Tokuro Fujiwara, who directed the original 1985 Ghost n’ Goblins game and SNES sequel). You can almost hear the latter group saying “Gotcha!” after each death that the player didn’t’ see coming. While nostalgic in its character movement and action dynamics, the level designs are wickedly clever and always changing, keeping you in a constant state of panic in fun and terrifying ways. <br><br>Skeletons rapidly rise from their graves as Arthur inches forward, and there’s always some kind of airborne threat positioned to knock him into a pit. The action demands split-second reflexes, but even more memorization of enemy patterns and placement, which is developed by dying. An edge can be obtained through Arthur’s weapon of choice, be it the quickly thrown daggers, the spreading fire of holy water, or a handful of other useful tools that can make short work of any foe. The action is simplistic in scope; you just jump and shoot in four directions, but it feels incredibly dynamic, making everything you do feel sk1llful.<br><br>All levels deliver wildly different challenges that make good use of the same moveset, yet players have some agency in how they progress through it. From the outset of the adventure, a choice between two levels is given, delivering either a shorter playthrough or the option to backtrack to missed stages to take on new horrors and earn more Umbral Bees. This oddly named collectible is a form of currency used to purchase useful spells, such as being able to turn every enemy onscreen into a frog or rain down lighting on them. The wealth of sk1lls is worth the effort, as some can be game changers in specific stages, much like getting the right weapon for a boss in Mega Man.<br><br>The entire game can also be played cooperatively, with the second player controlling a trio of ghosts called the Three Wise Guys, who can be swapped on the fly. Each of the guys aid Arthur in different ways, like being able to create a protective shield or lift him across a gap. It’s a cool idea for co-op play that helps take some of the sting out of the game’s difficulty. While the second player isn’t experiencing the core gameplay, they can still have a significant role in the outcome.<br><br>Even with the aid of a friend, the game is quick to alert you that you can lower the difficulty if situations are too challenging. If that doesn’t produce results, you can activate a magic metronome to slow the game’s speed to a crawl, giving you a hell of an advantage to fill enemies full of lances, safely bound up crumbling staircases, and grab Umbral Bees that may zip past you otherwise. If you think the game is too easy, the metronome can also be used to speed it up and make it more challenging. If you just want to see the entire game without any cares in the world, the lowest difficulty setting lets you instantly respawn where you die, although some of the late-game surprises are removed when played like this.<br><br>After the final boss is slain, players can restart their adventure to experience a slightly rearranged playthrough. This again holds true to the series’ roots, with transformed stages and new challenges within them. This is an awesome reason to play an amazing game again, and also gives the player a chance at earning every sk1ll.<br><br>As much fun as I had getting my butt handed to me by Resurrection, one of the best parts of it is the visual design. It looks like a storybook drawn with pencils and colored to make every moving element pop. Yes, some of the classic enemy designs are fairly uninspired, and the worlds are fairly plain in details, but together they jump off of the screen and frame the action perfectly.<br><br>Ghost 'n Goblins: Resurrection is a game of try and try again, and should you not have the chops to make it, has built in solutions to allow you to keep making progress. I didn’t think I needed another Ghost n’ Goblins game, but Capcom proved me wrong, and now I want more. <i>((Reviewed by Andrew Reiner))

			Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny is launching June 29 exclusively for Switch. The latest title in the quirky turn-based strategy series was announced last September and brings a host of new changes to the long-running franchise.

					
			For one, the game ditches the series’ traditional 2D sprites for fully 3D character models. A 32x mode speeds up battles exponentially, and the level cap has been raised to a staggering 99,999,999. But that’s not all! The release date trailer (posted below) also announces bonus content in the form of four additional characters from Disgaea’s past: Girl Laharl, Asagi, and Disgaea 2’s Adell and Rozalin. They, along with story content surrounding them, will be included in Disgaea 6 free of charge.<br><br> Disgaea 6 stars Zed, a cocky zombie residing in the lowest pits of the netherworld who can die and resurrect even stronger thanks to a new Super Reincarnation system. Zed’s world is rocked when a God of Destruction threatens to destroy everything, and it’s up to him to put a stop to it. Zed can’t do it alone, and he’s joined by his kid sister and a host of other zany characters (this is a Disgaea game after all).<br><br>Although Disgaea 6 is also launching for the PlayStation 4 in Japan, the game is only coming to Nintendo’s platform here in the west, at least for the time being. You can also pick up the Unrelenting Edition of the game that comes with a mini art book and digital soundtrack.   ((Reviewer : Marcus Stewart))

Following the murder of his wife, Mia, and the disappearance of his daughter Rose, Resident Evil Village's protagonist hits the ground running in the most terrible way imaginable. Waking up following an accident in a strange village, Ethan quickly finds out that there is more than what meets the eye in this town of horrors. We recently had a chance to sit down with the game to play out the first part of the latest tale from Capcom, and it didn't take long before we realized that there is so much more going on in this village than what meets the eye.</i><br><br><h6>gameplay</h6>The game mechanics are pleasantly familiar, making it easy to fall right back into the experience as a longtime Resident Evil fan. Uncovering make-do weapons, finding medicinal herbs to craft additional aid, and uncovering religious artifacts that help put together a picture of what's really going on in this new area all make up a familiar experience for those intimate with the franchise. Finding lockpicks, interacting with various aspects of each discoverable house, and continuing on the snow-laden paths eventually lead to discovering the first survivor that Ethan comes in contact with. With this introduction, Ethan is immediately thrown into a tango with Lycans. <br><br>When exploring the village, each bloodied home that stands as a horrific reminder that its days of peace are long gone, and that nostalgic feeling of abject terror that this series is known for was very much front and center. I found myself both dreading and eagerly anticipating what comes next each time I heard a floorboard creak, every footstep that sounded far too loud in my ears, and feeling terrified to embarrassing degrees every time I saw Ethan approach a new door slathered in blood. It's easy to see that this game is not going to have an underlayer of hope. Even the smallest glimmer of light is quickly snuffed out as our protagonist uncovers the mystery of Mother Miranda, the religious figurehead of this small town that appears to have turned on her flock, and he ultimately battles through Lycans to come face to face with new horrors. Disfigured beasts, haunting dolls come to life, and vampire-like creatures all make up a cacophony of horrors until the big moment finally arrives: coming face to face with Lady Dimitrescu herself within her castle.<br><br>Like with any Resident Evil game, the monsters that go bump in the night are a byproduct of the Umbrella Corporation. With Chris Redfield previously seen with a blue Umbrella logo (meant to indicate a "fresh start" on the road to penance for the company's past crimes with the T-virus) and back for a confrontation with Ethan, it's clear that this religious microcosm is the Umbrella's influence. Who is Mother Miranda, and where does her power over these incredible enemies comes from? Why did Chris 'erase' Mia, and what exactly is the bigger picture surrounding himself and our own Ethan? Resident Evil Village is poised to answer these questions and supply us with a billion others when the eighth game in the franchise arrives on May 7, 2021.

			<img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_box_art/public/2020/11/18/75039314/harvestmoononeworld.jpg" class="gameimage" style="float: left;"><h6>news</h6> Natsume and Rising Star Games have announced the upcoming title in the longstanding Harvest Moon franchise, coming this fall to the Nintendo Switch. Harvest Moon: One World, like other games in the series, is all about building up a farm, hanging out with villagers, and taking on various challenges. The new title features a new engine and graphics.<br><br>

					
			The story has been hinted at - you find yourself in a world without many of the staples that we enjoy, such as tomatoes, cabbage, and strawberries. Perhaps these delicious farm foods could be discovered through research and adventure, as an old book provides some clues to discovery. ((DANIEL TACK))<h6>about</h6>

					
			Take a trip around the world in the latest entry in the long-running Harvest Moon series! You'll ride camels across the deserts of Pastilla, venture deep into the snowy mountains of Salmiakki, and even visit a volcano near the cozy mountain town of Lebkuchen! Can you imagine a world without cabbage, tomatoes, or even carrots? Believe it or not, that's the world you'll find yourself in at the beginning of Harvest Moon: One World, as the Harvest Goddess, the queen of crops herself, has vanished... However, before the Harvest Goddess disappeared from this world, she imbued the tiny Harvest Wisps with the knowledge of various seeds, thus ensuring the various fruits and vegetables of the world would not be lost. Using the power given to these Harvest Wisps, you'll unlock various seeds as you progress through the game! But the Harvest Wisps can be tricky to find, as they all appear at different times and places. You'll need to use your noggin to make sure you seek out as many of them as you can!
					
			<h6>FEATURES</h6>
					
			<li>Explore 5 unique and colorful areas: the sprawling grasslands of Calisson, the gorgeous beaches of Halo Halo, the searing desert heat of Pastilla, the cozy hills of Lebkuchen, and the snowy mountains of Salmiakki!</li><li>
					
			Play as a boy or a girl and woo one of 5 handsome bachelors and 5 beautiful bachelorettes, each with their own unique personality and backstory!</li><li>
					
			Raise and keep animals such as cows, sheep, goats, and even reindeer!</li><li>
					
			Use your Expando-Farm to easily travel from one area to another!</li>
					
			<h6>more info</h6>The story of One World involves exploring an entire world (rather than just your quaint hometown), managing a farm while restoring a variety of familiar fruits and vegetables to the world.<br><br>   

					
			It's worth noting that what we know as "Harvest Moon" in North America is a bit complicated. It was originally the name for the series called Bokujō Monogatari in Japan. Today, that series is called Story of Seasons in North America, while Natsume has continued developing its own farming/life simulations under the Harvest Moon banner.<br><br>

					
			Even if this isn't the same series as the Harvest Moon you remember from titles like Friends of Mineral Town and A Wonderful Life, One World still has plenty of potential to deliver a pleasant, peaceful simulation on modern hardware. ((joe juba))

			Monster Hunter Rise is an action RPG that will transport players to the colorful Kamura Village, an all-new serene mountain locale that attracts visitors with its unique culture and innovative hunting technologies. After hunters equip their armor and select from one of the various weapon types, all-new hunting grounds await, including the ancient Shrine Ruins and more. As players defeat monsters and progress through the game, items from fallen foes can be used to craft unique weapons and armor that will increase their chances of future success and survival. Hunters can tackle these challenges solo, or with up to three other players in local or cooperative online play.<br><br>

					
			Evolving the Monster Hunter series, Monster Hunter Rise will provide players with an inventive set of new tools to track down and defeat threatening monsters. For the first time ever in a Monster Hunter game, wire-based grappling actions can be performed by using a “Wirebug” while standing or in mid-air, adding an all-new level of aerial maneuverability to hunting strategies and attacks. The game will also debut new hunting partners called Palamutes, personalized and rideable “Canyne” companions that will provide players with a new set of attack options, while “Felyne” Palicoes will return as support characters for actions like healing.

					
			<br><br><h6>Features</h6>

					
			<li>Rise to New Heights – The debut of the new “Wirebug” mechanic allows for wire-based grappling actions that can be used to scale cliffs and other hard-to-reach areas, providing new traversal and aerial attack options.</li><li>
					
			New and Returning Monsters – The game will introduce Magnamalo, a menacing new flagship monster, as well as other new monsters like the shape-shifting Aknosom, the amphibious Tetranadon, and more. Hunters can also expect to encounter numerous fan-favorite and returning species from previous Monster Hunter games.</li><li>
					
			Canyne Companions – New hunting partners called Palamutes can be personalized and used to ride across the terrain, providing players with all-new traveling and attack options. On solo hunts, players can select both a Palamute and Palico to assist them, while multiplayer hunters can bring one or the other into the field.</li><li>
					
			The Rampage – In addition to the plethora of solo and multiplayer quests, the immersive story mode will task aspiring hunters with discovering the secrets behind the puzzling “Rampage” events that threaten Kamura Village.</li><li>
					
			Hunting Options – Play solo, or join up to three other hunters in local or online co-op play. The Nintendo Switch system also allows for hunting anywhere, anytime and with anyone!</li><li>
					
			Seamless Gameplay – Featuring maps with no loading times, the continuous gameplay ensures that players will remain on their quests as soon as the hunt begins, without transitions between areas.</li><br><br>

					
			<h6>reviews</h6><img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2020/10/09/6bce760e/mhrise_great_wirebug_on_field.jpg"  style="width:35%;border: 2px solid #bfc4ea; padding:2px; padding-bottom: 2px; float:right;margin-left:10px;">Unveiled during a Direct event, Monster Hunter Rise is the next big game in the Monster Hunter franchise coming to Nintendo Switch. Unlike many of the 3DS games, the map is a fluid experience — only one load into the area, no loading between various map sections or chunks. A brief chat with the development team on Zoom allowed us to dig into some of the various aspects of Monster Hunter Rise that make it stand out.<br><br>A new feature called the wirebug (which actually seems kind of similar to the Clutch Claw from Monster Hunter World) allows players to both traverse the environments at high speed and also weave the wirebug into powerful, weapon-specific attacks. Sidekicks have been a prominent part of the franchise for a while, offering support in combat. You've probably spent a lot of time with Palicoes, our feline friends, but now a new sidekick is about to come into the spotlight — the palamute! It's a doggo! Palamutes are more offense-oriented than palicoes, and you can even ride them around like mounts.<img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2021/02/26/b0f093e1/monster_hunter_rise.jpg" style="width:35%;border: 2px solid #bfc4ea; padding:2px; padding-bottom: 2px; float:left;margin-right:10px;"> Cats and dogs? Guess the next pet that shows up in the Monster Hunter series! Get a good look at the palamute and a lot more in the TGS trailer below.<br><br>Players can party up in four-player multiplayer in both local and online co-op. In Monster Hunter World, it was often frustrating to have to go through cutscenes over and over again. Thankfully, cutscenes can actually be skipped in this game. There won't be G Rank or Master rank quest experiences, only Low Rank and High Rank, though we don't know if the higher difficulty tier may be added in the future. A maximum of three monsters can be on any map at any given time, similar to other games in the franchise. When asked about how the team determines which monsters to bring back to the games, the response was that they determine which environments and locations to create first, and then select monsters that would be appropriate to those areas. <br><br>Players can now all bring one pet companion into the four-player experience. If only one or two players are in a mission, they can bring two pets each! That's a lot of bark, bite, and meow! All in all, from what's known so far, Monster Hunter Rise looks similar to other Monster Hunter offerings, with a few slight iterations to keep things fresh. We'll find out more as we plod toward release next year. And Monster Hunter Rise isn't the only new title in the Monster Hunter universe coming to Switch. ((Daniel Tack))

					
			
					
			

					
			<br><br><h6>news</h6>The upcoming release of Monster Hunter Rise is an exciting launch for longtime fans of the RPG series from Capcom, bringing with it more combat, more palicoes, and even some good puppers. While the Switch release is set in stone for March 26, Capcom has confirmed that a Monster Hunter Rise PC port is on the way but will be a staggered launch like games in the past. Much like Monster Hunter World, Rise is slated for a PC date sometime in 2022. <br><br>As to whether or not we'll see an Xbox and PlayStation port, that remains to be seen. Currently, Monster Hunter Rise is slated for a March 26 launch on Nintendo Switch with a PC release sometime in 2022. Could that open up to more platforms? It's possible! But at this time, these are the only two that are confirmed.

			A series of Kingdom Hearts games by Square Enix are scheduled to release this March</b><br><br>

					
			<li><b>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix</b> : <i>Square Enix’s unlikely combination of Final Fantasy and Disney characters became a megahit following its 2002 release. Eleven years later, Kingdom Hearts holds up surprisingly well in this HD remaster collection. <br>The core of this collection is the excellent original game, and that’s where your attention should be. The other two lowly offerings are inessential bonus ­features.</i>
					
			<br><i>Release: September 10, 2013 (PlayStation 3), March 28, 2017 (PlayStation 4), February 18, 2020 (Xbox One), March 30, 2021 (PC)</i></li>		

					
			<li><b>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix</b> : <i>Kingdom Hearts II serves as the centerpiece of the collection. Like the first Kingdom Hearts, the plodding Roxas intro serves more as something to bust through than relish. I enjoyed approaching it from a new perspective, however, knowing what I do now about his past. When this originally released, the mystery of what’s going on pulled you through, but after 358/2 Days it takes on a bittersweet tone. Once Sora’s back at the helm, the fun combat and Disney interactions take over, and the experience measures up to my memories of the original.</i>  
					
			<br><i>Release: December 2, 2014 (PlayStation 3), March 28, 2017 (PlayStation 4), February 18, 2020 (Xbox One), March 30, 2021 (PC)</i></li>
					
			
					
			<li><b>Kingdom Hearts 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</b> : <i>fter various spin-offs and re-releases, the buildup to Kingdom Hearts III has been nothing if not drawn out. Kingdom Hearts II launched more than a decade ago, and a whole new generation of gamers can play the early entries thanks to HD remasters on PS3 (and later this year on the PS4). Final Chapter Prologue should be the last new remaster before Kingdom Hearts III; it includes Dream Drop Distance (originally a 3DS exclusive) for the first time on the big screen. Additionally, an episode starring Aqua and a mini-movie, which shows how this crazy journey all began, are both new for this entry. As convoluted as the Kingdom Hearts storyline is, after playing through this collection, I have a clearer understanding of the narrative leading into Kingdom Hearts III.

			<li><b>Kingdom Hearts III</b> : <i>The story is a dream come true for devoted fans. Kingdom Hearts III explores plot  that wind through 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep, Re:coded, and more; the narrative picks up where Dream Drop Distance left off, with Sora attempting to regain and enhance his lost power to stand a chance against Xehanort. So much has happened to so many different characters in the franchise, and spotting these familiar faces in Kingdom Hearts III and learning what they’ve been up to is exciting and makes the years of investment feel worthwhile.</i>

I don’t want to spoil anything, but the overall story is incomprehensible and outlandish.

			<li><b>Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory</b> : <i>Since its 2002 debut, the Kingdom Hearts series has taken players on an unpredictable ride, containing everything from human replicas to time travel. One thing has remained constant, though: Stellar music. Whether it’s the poignant character themes or heart-pumping battle tracks, composer Yoko Shimomura has stayed at the top of her game, creating arrangements that have become core to the series’ identity. Rhythm game Melody of Memory is the ultimate tribute to this musical talent, offering a massive catalog of over 140 tracks to relive. The end result is proof that moving the spotlight onto this component wasn’t unwarranted. While not without its faults, Melody of Memory is a refreshing way to look back at Kingdom Hearts’ long journey thus far, and even gives fans just enough breadcrumbs to anticipate what’s next.</i>

			The Game Awards 2020 contained plenty of reveals. This one can only be described as a blast from the past. The way past. Ghosts 'n Goblins was one of those ancient greats that had you coming back for more even as you got absolutely destroyed in the first level. It was a battle against all kinds of horrible undead opponents and monsters, and now the franchise is coming back with an all new title injected with plenty of familiar aspects from Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts.<br><br> Get ready for Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection coming to the Switch on February 25. <br><br>

					
			Take on zombies, skeletons, pigmen, and many other iconic opponents in your quest, with new art direction and design. Even with their new takes, they're quite recognizable. I'm curious as to how this new offering in the series will handle the difficulty of the game, because the original game was a memorization muscle memory nightmare, cool as it was. <br><br><i>Are you going to be able to play with unlimited lives? Cheat codes? None of the above? We'll see. But the original classics were definitely games that defined the term "Nintendo-hard." </i>

			Following the reveal of the Mario-inspired Red + Blue Nintendo Switch console earlier this morning, Nintendo also showed off the latest Super Mario adventure for fans to partake in with Super Mario 3D + Bowser's Fury. Bowser pretty much goes Super Saiyan in the Fury reveal, offering a different way to experience a beloved universe. <br><br>

					
			While some Nintendo fans will already be aware of what Super Mario 3D World has to offer from the original on the Wii U, the Super Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury bundle will have more than a few new content drops to enjoy. With 3D World, players can take to colorful levels to play solo or with friends as they transform into iconic Nintendo characters like Peach, Toad, and the popular Mario brothers themselves. <br><br>

					
			<i> “We hope players enjoy pouncing their way through two great Mario adventures in Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury, with lots of feline fun to be had whether playing solo or with family and friends,” said Nick Chavez, Nintendo of America’s Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing when talking about the company's latest announcement. “Along with the Nintendo Switch – Mario Red & Blue Edition system, we’re delighted to offer these new products that mark more than 35 years of Super Mario adventures.” </i><br><br>

			Scott PIlgrim vs The World: The Game - Complete Edition is coming January 14th, Ubisoft announced today. The game, first announced during the Ubisoft Forward event in September, originally had a vague 2020 launch window.  

					
			The Complete Edition resurrects the fan-favorite brawler, which launched in 2010 and is based on the popular Scott Pilgrim graphic novel series (and bolstered the live-action film released the same year). The game draws heavily from classic beat em’ ups like River City Ransom, with up to four players controlling Scott, his girlfriend Ramona Flowers, and his buds Kim Pine and Stephen Stills. Players go around punching all manner of wacky enemies to take down Ramona’s seven evil exes, all while being inundated with a boatload of comic and video game references.  

					
			Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game was widely acclaimed, including a 9/10 from Game Informer. Unfortunately, it was delisted from digital storefronts in December 2014 likely due to the license expiring. The news of Scott Pilgrim’s revival came as a surprise to many fans who assumed the game would be trapped on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hard drives for eternity. 

					
			The Complete Edition bundles the full game along with all of its DLC. That includes playable characters Knives Chau and Wallace Wells, as well as the Dodge b4ll and Battle Royal modes. The game is currently slated to launch for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. ((Marcus Stewart))

		<h5>12.03.20 | Immortals Fenyx Rising | PS5, XBX/S, PS4, XB1, SW, Stadia, PC</h5>

					
			<img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_box_art/public/2020/11/13/89b836e8/immortalsfenyxrising.jpg" class="gameimage" style="float: left;"><h6>ABOUT</h6> 
					
			When a powerful titan defeats the Greek gods and scatters them across the Golden Isle, an unproven shield-bearer named Fenyx washes up on shore. More of a storyteller than a soldier, Fenyx must now write a legend of their own, reuniting the gods and challenging the evil force known as Typhon in an ultimate underdog story. Much like its protagonist, Immortals Fenyx Rising strives to be more than a game that just repeats the glories of others; it adds its own mythical flair on top of developer Ubisoft Quebec’s previous work on Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. The result is an exciting and unique open-world adventure worthy of a place in the gaming pantheon.
					
			<br><br>
			Exploring the Golden Isle is a joyous experience. Rich visuals (inspired by Studio Ghibli’s films) create lush and diverse biomes, and your traversal abilities make it simple to navigate the world. Fenyx (who can be male or female) can climb nearly any surface as long as they have the stamina, or jump off a mountain or statue and glide across long distances with ease. Even when I had fast-travel options to reach my destination quicker, I typically opted to make the journey manually. Every corner I turned or nook I explored rewarded me with puzzles to solve or enemies to battle for gear, resources, and other rewards.
					
			<br><br>
			With a narrative that involves a world-reshaping beast alongside the mightiest warriors, gods, and monsters of Greek mythology, you may think Immortals Fenyx Rising takes itself seriously. However, its high stakes and dark premise are punctuated by comedy, providing a lighthearted tone full of endearing moments with many of its characters. While the jokes don’t always land, I appreciated the strong mix of sarcasm, self-deprecation, and fourth-wall breaking. While an out-of-nowhere joke has the potential to take you out of the action-packed story, the writing is done in a masterful way that keeps the tone consistent throughout, making neither the serious moments or the comedic ones feel out of place.
					
			<br><br>
			Immortals contains all the ingredients I want from an epic, open-world adventure steeped in mythology. With empowering combat, rewarding exploration, and a story that shines a spotlight on its characters through humor, Immortals Fenyx Rising leverages its myriad inspirations to discover its own identity and deliver an outstanding open-world experience.

			<h6>history</h6>
					
			Haven is a departure from the Game Bakers’ previous renowned game, Furi. While they share a similar theme of fighting for freedom, the context and game feel is entirely different. Haven allows players a look into the everyday life of a mature, loving relationship of Yu and Kay and while inviting players to relax, laugh, and connect to the characters. While Haven is not without fighting, thrills, and unexpected surprises, it does take the players on a journey often not explored in games: one of a true adult relationship. In Haven, players level up the more time the couple spends together, and they even must fight together, placing emphasis on the importance of the relationship.. The Game Bakers hopes that players will ponder nuanced and important questions about the meaning of love and freedom and if love is worth sacrificing everything for.

			In 873 AD, war and overcrowding in Norway prompts Eivor and their brother Sigurd to lead their clan of Vikings to settle new lands in Anglo-Saxon England, as part of the Viking expansion across Europe. The clan comes into conflict with the kingdoms of Wesse-x, Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia over the next several years, as well as the warring sons of the legendary Viking warrior Ragnar Lothbrok, who made up the Great Heathen Army. Eivor's clan will face forces led by the leaders of these kingdoms, including Alfred the Great, the king of Wess-ex. It is during this time that Eivor meets the Hidden Ones and joins their fight against the Order of the Ancients. Explorable cities include Winchester, London, and York. Parts of Norway will also be included..<br><br>


					
			As with previous games in the series, Valhalla features a narrative set in the modern day. This story will follow Layla Hassan, a character featured in Origins and Odyssey. Valhalla will also contain story elements related to the Isu, who, as part of the lore of the Assassin's Creed series, are an advanced civilisation that pre-date humanity..<br><br>


					
			Assassin's Creed Valhalla is an open world action-adventure game, structured around several main story quests and numerous optional side missions. The player takes on the role of Eivor (/ˈeɪvɔːr/), a Viking raider, as they lead their fellow Vikings against the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The player will have the choice of playing Eivor as either male (voiced by Magnus Bruun ) or female (voiced by Cecilie Stenspil ) and is able to customise Eivor's hair, warpaint, clothing, armor, and tattoos. The variety of weapons available to the player has been expanded to include weapons such as flails and greatswords. Combat has been changed to allow dual wielding of almost any weapon, including shields, and every piece of gear that the player collects is unique. The Eagle Vision mechanic of previous titles will return in the form of "Odin Sight". The player's companion animal will be a raven named Sýnin(Old Norse for "insight") who can be used to scout the nearby areas, much like previous avian companions had done in Origins and Odyssey, and other parts of the game world from afar before Eivor engages in combat. There will be more focus on the stealth aspects for both traversing the game world and in combat. The "social stealth" concept from earlier Assassin's Creed games will return: Eivor can hide from enemies not only in stationary environmental objects, but can pull down their hood and slip into certain crowds to use them as cover. Eivor can feign death, use their raven to distract guards, and can access a hidden blade for near instantaneous assassinations. The game's key bosses will all, through specific combinations of approach, tactics, and weapon selection, be able to be assassinated through a single attack, but still can be defeated through numerous other routes.<br><br>


					
			Valhalla will have a similar structure of main story missions and a number of optional side missions. While the main storyline in past Assassin's Creed games typically moved linearly through the main sections of the game world, Valhalla has the player often returning back to the main settlement and back to areas previously visited as information about the new areas of England are learned by the Vikings through reconnaissance or from contacts. Not all missions require violent ends, with some that can be resolved through diplomatic means.[14] Player choices through conversation or gameplay options will affect the characters and their political alliances with other non-player characters. The game will rely less on a traditional leveling system and instead focus more on the selection of sk1lls through sk1ll trees selected by the player as Eivor advances through the game. The difficulty posed by enemies will be rated based on the player's collection of sk1lls.

			<h5>11.00.20 | Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory | PS4 XB1 SWITCH  </h5>
					
			<h6>ABOUT</h6> 
					
			Melody of Memory retells the story of the Dark Seeker Saga, starting with the first Kingdom Hearts and moving in order through Kingdom Hearts III. This is done through Kairi, who reflects upon the events of the series, narrating for the player. Series creator and director Tetsuya Nomura said "once we go through the story of recollection and beyond that, we start to see a timeline that will connect to the future." The game also continues Kairi's story immediately after the end of the Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind downloadable content scenario. Nomura stated the character's childhood would be explored, which had been mostly a mystery up until this point, but cautioned the new story was "not meant to advance things significantly". He added that "there are hints sprinkled throughout" regarding the Master of Masters, with Nomura acknowledging the character and the title sharing an acronym (MoM). Suzui felt the game was a "summary" of the Kingdom Hearts series "in a nice, easy to digest format" while still featuring "hints about what's coming next" in the franchise. Melody of Memory features 47 worlds from the series (31 Disney and 16 original worlds) and 33 locations known as "dark holes" where the boss battle songs take place. As many Disney worlds were chosen as possible, with Suzui calling it "robust" while not feeling "like a rush through a collection of the entire series".<br><br>

					
			Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory is a rhythm action game featuring both single and multiplayer gameplay. Players press buttons with the right timing to get an Excellent, Good, or Miss, depending on the timing. A Miss affects the player's health, which causes the game to end when it has run out. Players work to level up the characters' health and attack power, with each character having two types of ranged and melee attack abilities.<br><br>

					
			The main single player mode is World Tour, which is the "story campaign" of the game. Each song is categorized into a stage, either Field Battle (world exploration tracks), where players complete songs rhythmically in each world, and face appropriate enemies in each stage from the original games in which the song is based on,] Memory Dive (tracks associated with a specific character or uses vocals), where players replay stages from past games in music video-like sequences with gameplay similar to Field Battles, and Boss Battle (tracks associated with bosses), where players face bosses from the series. After songs have been completed, they can be replayed individually. Melody of Memory features three-person parties, of which there are four different groupings. Once new parties have been unlocked, they can be used at any time. Disney and Pixar characters serve as guest members in their specific themed worlds, bringing different sounds and symbols to the gameplay. Traversal between each of the worlds is done through the Gummi Ship, a system used in previous mainline Kingdom Hearts games. Melody of Memory features the series' Beginner, Standard, and Proud difficulties, while each stage has three play options available: Basic; One Button, which removes button complexity and allows party members to auto-attack; and Performer, which adds additional enemies and button sequences. Each stage features various objectives to complete, that award material to unlock new songs and items. Clearing stages unlocks a music and cinematic scene player.<br><br>

					
			Multiplayer modes include Double Play co-op mode, where players compete locally together playing as Sora and Riku to get the highest collective score, COM versus, where players compete against the computer to get a high rank three times out of five, and versus mode, where players compete against each other online or with local multiplayer (Nintendo Switch only) for the best score in a best 2 out of 3. This mode features "tricks", which are used to disrupt the other player, once at the beginning of the track and again towards the end. There are 10 different types of tricks, with co-director Masanobu Suzui saying they make completing the songs "more tricky and complicated" given how players can combine the tricks. Winning in versus mode increases a player's ranking and awards two collectible cards, while the runner-up receives one. The Nintendo Switch version of the game features a free-for-all battle royal mode, where up to eight players can compete against each other in local multiplayer. The gameplay of Melody of Memory has been compared to Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.

			Like the previous Hyrule Warriors, Age of Calamity mixes the hack-and-slash gameplay of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series of video games with settings, characters, and other elements from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. In addition to retaining the combat, material crafting, and weapon-upgrade systems from Hyrule Warriors, the game incorporates environmental puzzle solving and the use of the Sheikah Slate tool from Breath of the Wild. Confirmed playable characters include Link, Princess Zelda, the Four Champions, Daruk, Mipha, Revali, and Urbosa, and the Sheikah warrior, Impa. The game will also feature compatibility with Nintendo's amiibo figures, with figures of the Four Champions re-releasing alongside. <br><br>

					
			Players can use resources to access new areas, build weapons, and cook foods that can be used as buffs. Weapons in this game are invulnerable and won't break over time, unlike in Breath of the Wild. The map is similar to the one for Breath of the Wild. Players can choose stages and use the Sheikah Tower to explore between regions. <br><br>

					
			Age of Calamity is set 100 years before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The story depicts the Great Calamity, a great war alluded to in Breath of the Wild between the armies of Hyrule and the forces of Calamity Ganon that resulted in the collapse of the kingdom.

			Sackboy is a pretty adorable fellow, but what does he have beyond his good looks? A Big Adventure isn’t going to be exploring his inner demons or diving into his deepest thoughts, but Sumo is stuffing a little bit of story and context into the game. <br><br>
			“We start in Sackboy’s hometown, which is the village of Loom,” Waterhouse says. “This is where all the sacklings of Craftworld live. Sackboy is a bit different from the other sackfolk; he’s always dreamed of adventure, he’s always wanted to see what lies beyond the borders of his village. Perhaps slightly unexpectedly, but also perhaps predictably, he gets his chance because one day: The game’s villain, a nefarious trickster called Vex descends upon Loom and he kidnaps all of the sacklings that live there and enslaves them to build a machine.” <br><br>
			If activated, this machine will turn Craftworld upside-down and inside-out. As you may imagine, that’s not a great scenario. I was a little surprised to hear all of these story beats; for a series that’s put more of a premium on aesthetics and player agency, I wasn’t expecting all of this, well, lore. Waterhouse says the team thought providing that kind of context was important. “We felt that by starting the game and showing where he was from and showing his friends and giving that context, that gave us this platform to really show his growth on this journey to become a knitted knight, which is sort of part of his quest, if you like.”<br><br>

					
			This fun little sack-boy game is a great family-friendly game with fantastic co-op modes, perks and challenges.

		<h5>11.10.20 | Godfall | ps5 pc  </h5>
					
			<h6>ABOUT</h6> 
					
			The combat philosophy for Godfall revolves around offensive movement, encouraging players to constantly move their knight around the battlefield to confront a variety of foes. Each of five different weapon classes each has its own movesets, including the longsword, dual blades, polearm, two-handed warhammer, and the two-handed great sword.<Br><br>

					
			The demo offered a closer look at two of those weapon styles.The dual blades are especially fast, and are good for soft and unarmored enemies. Inner focus is unique to dual blades, allowing for increased damage for a time, and mortal coil, which pulls enemies to you. Longswords are simple weapons without a big focus on combos. Clearly meant as an accessible weapon for all players, this weapon style includes a spiral technique, for a line attack, as well as a shield uppercut with good timing. The demo also focused on the flexibility of the shield, which players always have access to, which allows for everything from parries to shield throws.

		<h5>10.01.20 | Mario 35 | Switch  </h5>

					
			<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/teaser_promoted_image_thumbnail/s3/2020/09/03/904dec62/mario35.jpg" class="gameimage" style="float: left;"><h6>ABOUT</h6> 
					
			It's been a huge year for Nintendo and now the latest news for fans reveals of <b>Super Mario 3D All-Stars, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, Super Mario All-Stars on Switch, and Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros</b>. If that's not enough, Nintendo also announced<b> Super Mario Bros. 35, a 35-player free-for-all that's reminiscent of Tetris 99's (online) mayhem, but for Mario</b>.<br><br>

					
			Like the name indicates, 35 players compete in a race to see who can survive the longest. As players run through classic Super Mario Bros. levels, enemies they defeat will be launched into their opponents' screens, adding to the chaos. It looks like either the greatest idea ever (when you're winning) or a completely terrible mess (when you aren't). <br><br>

					
			Super Mario Bros. 35 is coming exclusively to Nintendo Switch (online) subscribers starting November 1. It won't cost members anything more than their existing subscription fees, but it's only going to be live until March 31, 2021 – so be sure to get your fill of it when it does become available for download.

		<h5>10.02.20 | Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time | PS4, Xbox One   </h5>

					
			<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/product_box_art/s3/2020/06/22/93cf6c3f/crashbandicoot4.jpg" class="gameimage" style="float: left;"><h6>ABOUT</h6> 
					
			The opening cinematic for Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is of an extreme close up of Neo Cortex. He’s laughing maniacally, aggression lines his brow, but his eyes carry a different story – they’re crazed nearly to the point of spinning. The camera pulls out to show Cortex is violently beating something with a stick. As we continue to drift away from Cortex, we see his anger is being taken out on a straw dummy made to look like Crash Bandicoot. He’s beating it senseless.<br><br>

					
			As we pull back more, we see Cortex is trapped on a small asteroid floating deep in space. This shot not only shows us he’s losing his mind, but he isn’t alone on this rock. He’s joined by the equally notorious Doctor N. Tropy, who just happens to be conversing with Uka Uka, a floating mask that may out-evil both N. Tropy and Cortex combined.<br><br>

					
			As the trio argues about their fate on the asteroid and how they need to keep trying to escape from this floating prison, we are shown a quick snapshot of a rock used as a chalkboard has 22 tally marks on it. This number is significant in two ways: For this story, it shows the number of years the villains have been stranded here, and for us in the real world, the number of years that have passed since the release of Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped on PlayStation.<br><br>

					
			It’s About Time’s story picks up exactly where that game left off 22 years ago. Developer Toys for Bob is essentially retconning all of the sequels and stories that came after, designing It’s About Time to be a true continuation of the original PlayStation trilogy.<br><br>
			The intro movie concludes with Uka Uka growing so angry that he knocks himself out, but his rage opens a tear in time and space that leads to the world he previously tried to conquer. When finding a way to escape, his science wasn’t exact; the tear also leads to different dimensions and eras. Cortex and N. Tropy waste no time fleeing the asteroid. Although Uka Uka is their savior in this moment, they leave him behind.

					
			<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/full/s3/2020/09/08/52f53b85/tawnacrash4.jpg" class="gameimage" style="float: right;" title="Tawna">Entities that are tuned to the cosmos are aware there’s a tear and that time and space are being upended. Aku Aku, the mask that has sworn to protect the Bandicoot family, is one of those beings hit with a sense of dread, and fears something terrible is about to happen. He hastily awakens Crash, who just happens to be napping on an old patched-up couch sitting on N. Sanity Beach. The orange marsupial is startled but determined to help his old friend.<br><br>

					
			For fans of this series, N. Sanity Beach was the first level that greeted players in the original Crash Bandicoot game. Within a couple of minutes of starting this new adventure, Toys for Bob cleverly connects the final moment of the PlayStation trilogy with its first shot. The journey players are about to embark on is backed heavily by nostalgia, but the story carries the promise of going to unexpected places and trying new things. Crash won’t just be running through jungles. He’ll be traveling to prehistoric times and even to a fishing town operated by zombies.  <br><br>

			<p id="blurb"><b>N E W S  U P D A T  E </b> Crash Bandicoot's old flame, Tawna, has made her triumphant return in a new gameplay video. Tawna joins a small list of other fan-favorite playable characters like Dingodile and Doctor Neo Cortex, and emerges as the most nimble of the bunch. As Tawna, players have access to a wall jump ability that can enable access to hard-to-reach ledges as well as a grappling hook that can be used to navigate levels faster or fight off enemies. In addition to the Tawna gamepay reveal, Toys for Bob announced that a Crash Bandicoot 4 demo will be available for players who have already pre-ordered the game.

		<strong class="bord">Darwin's Game</strong>
		<b> Genres: Drama, Action, Horror </b> |  If you were to cross Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman's adrenaline-charged social thriller Nerve with the mystery-driven ultra-violence of Hiroya Oku's Gantz, it'd probably look something like Darwin's Game. Based on artist "Ginko" and writer Yuki Takahata's manga of the same name, the anime centers on 17-year-old Kaname Sudō, who, after accepting an mysterious invite from a recently deceased friend, is thrust into a deadly supernatural bloodsport known only as Darwin's Game. Pitted against a cadre of sociopaths and with no way to seek help from the outside world, Kaname must rely on his wits and will to survive while searching for a means to escape this living nightmare. Produced by studio Nexus, the 11-episode series is penned entirely by series author Yuki Takahata, resulting in an adaptation that's a near one-to-one match with the source material. If you're looking for a taut action series with serious mystery drama, Darwin's Game is a solid choice. -Rated 10/10- (Fun.)

		<strong class="bord">Pet</strong>
		<b> Genres: Creepy, Psychedelic, Drama </b> |  Pet is a real mindscrew, in more ways than one. Based on Ranjō Miyake's manga of the same name, the series follows Tsukasa and Hitomi, two empaths with the ability to delve inside the minds of others and manipulate their memories and perceptions. Employed by a shadowy organization known simply as "The Company," the pair are tasked with using their abilities to cover up crimes, assassinations, and commit all sorts of unsavory acts, more often than not at the expense of innocent lives and their own fractured psyches. The dialogue can be frustratingly obtuse at times, with crucial terms like "peaks" and "valleys" thrown out of left field with little if any formal explanation, and the initial episodes can be a bit hard to follow with regard to what is being seen or perceived by whom at any given moment. Hang in there, though -- it's a story that gradually makes more sense the longer it goes on and rewards the closer you pay attention. And barring even that, it's still worth a watch for the psychedelic visuals alone. Think of it as a more freakish take on Christopher Nolan's Inception by way of Philip K. Dick's Ubik. - Rated 8/10 - </i> (Prime)

		<strong class="bord">Somali and the Forest Spirit</strong>
		<b> Genres: Drama, Fantasy </b> |  If your tastes veer more towards the whimsical fare of Studio Ghibli than explicitly action-oriented titles, Somali and the Forest Spirit is a perfect choice. Set in a world of magic and sorcery populated by spirits, goblins, and all sorts of creatures, the series follows the journey of a forest-protecting golem and their companion, a precocious child named Somali. Together, the two embark on a search for a home for Somali among the last of the humans, a race of beings previously thought to have been persecuted and hunted to the brink of extinction ages ago. Think Alphonse and Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist, but instead of two brothers in search of the philosopher's stone to restore their bodies, it's a father figure and their adoptive ward searching for safety and security in a world of dangers at every turn. With exquisite backgrounds, disarming humor, and a story with genuine emotional pull, Somali and the Forest Spirit is a spirited fable of parenthood and love found in the most unlikely of circu.mstances.

		<strong class="bord">In/Spectre</strong>
		<b> Genres: Fantasy, Action, Family</b> |  Supernatural mystery series are a dime a dozen when it comes to anime, so it’s refreshing when one comes along that has as intriguing a premise and personality as In/Spectre. Based on Kyo Shirodaira’s novel series, In/Spectre follows 15-year-old Iwanaga Kotoko, a university student who four years prior to the series’s start was anointed as the "Goddess of Wisdom" of the spirit world at the cost of her left leg and right eye. Acting as an intermediary between the human and spirit world, Kotoko is tasked with solving disputes and discrepancies between the two. There’s just one problem: Kuro Sakuragawa, Kotoko’s fast-made companion and boyfriend, is a surprisingly fearsome entity with mysterious powers that strike fear in the spirits who Kotoko is charged with protecting. A serial mystery crossed with an odd-couple rom-com that occasionally pokes at the fourth wall, In/Spectre is a gorgeously animated series with fun twists, delightful characters, and engrossing cases that'll keep you hooked to the end.

		<strong class="bord">Kaguya-sama: Love is War </strong>
		<b> Genres: Romance, Action, Comedy, Drama</b> |  Student council president Miyuki Shirogane and vice president Kaguya Shinomiya return for another season of machiavellian shenanigans and romantic hijinks! The first season of Kaguya-sama: Love is War was one of last year’s standout new series, a devious and hilarious twist on the classic ‘will-they-won’t-they’ formula of high school rom-com anime. Season 2 has even more in the way of lovestruck mishaps between Miyuki and Kaguya, as well as more time spotlighting old and new breakout favorites such as the Kaguya's hyper-capable assistant Ai Hayasaki and Miyuki’s icy cool sister Kei. And better, the second season is just self-contained enough that viewers new to the series could pop in to watch this one without missing a beat. Kaguya-sama: Love is War is uproariously hilarious, stylistically inventive, and easily one of the best anime rom-coms to come out this year. (Fun.)

		<b> Genres: Comedy, Drama, Action</b> | Makoto Edamura is Japan's greatest con-man. Or at least, that's what he thinks until he's bested by Laurent Thierry, a suave and masterful gentleman thief who eyes up the young Edamura to join his globe-trotting crew as his apprentice. Traveling the world from San Francisco to Singapore, London and beyond, Edamura learns the tricks of the trade as he cons the criminal elite's most dastardly plutocrats while growing up along the way, all tinged with the same sense of humor that you'd find in any of the Ocean's movies. Directed by Hiro Kaburagi (91 Days, Speed Grapher) and written by screenwriter Ryota Kosawa, Great Pretender is a death-defying, high-wire heist drama packed with a dazzling art design, beautiful vistas, and an infectiously jazzy score (Nflix)

		<b> Genres: Action, Comedy, Violence, Drama </b> |  Based on Q Hayashida’s cult dark fantasy sci-fi manga of the same name, Dorohedoro is set in the Hole, a harsh derelict metropolis populated by humans and an ever-increasing number of unfortunate souls transformed into chimeric monstrosities by malicious sorcerers from another dimension. The series follows Caiman, an amnesiac bounty hunter and his best friend Nikaido as they scour the depths of the Hole in search of the sorcerer who cursed him with a lizard’s head. Oh yeah, he’s also got a sentient human head at the back of his throat that pops up Xenomorph-style whenever Caiman swallows his prey to search for the culprit. It only gets weirder from there. Packed to the brim with gnarly violence, leather-clad weirdos, pitch-black humor, and more than a few moments of light-hearted levity, Dorohedoro is a dark and impressive hybrid-CG anime that combines dystopian body-horror and slice-of-life comedy to make for one of the most exciting and unique new series to come out in 2020.

Legoshi's primal and emotional awakening is exacerbated by his status as a carnivore, forcing him to confront the terrifying question of whether what he feels for Haru is simply his instinctual urge to hunt and destroy, or something more.

		<strong class="bord">Keep your Hands off Eizouken!</strong>
		<b> Genres: Comedy, Slice of Life, Drama</b> |  Based on Sumito Ōwara's manga series of the same name, Keep Your Hands off Eizouken! follows high schooler Midori and her friends Sayaka and Tsubame as they attempt to establish an anime club on their school's campus and produce their own animated film. What follows is a wild odyssey of the highs and lows of trying to break into animation, the type of comedic and disarmingly earnest portrayal of youthful ambition in the face of opposition, and inexperience that reaffirms why you fell in love with anime in the first place. Brimming with meticulous nods to some of the medium's finest creators and a mischievously meta sense of creativity that'll have even the most stone-faced of viewers grinning ear to ear, it's the kind of show you could only expect from the likes of Masaaki Yuasa (Devilman Crybaby, Ping Pong the Animation, etc.) and the team behind Science Saru. Top that with an infectiously trippy title theme and score courtesy of rap duo chelmico and experimental producer Oorutaichi and you've got one of the most memorable and hilarious anime of the year.
