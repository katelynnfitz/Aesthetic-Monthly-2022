						<h2>ART GALLERY THEMES</h2>
						<div class="date-info">
							<a href="/art/gallery.phtml">The Art Gallery</a> is one of many contests that the Neopets site has to offer. For this one, you submit some of your own original Neopets fan art. If your image is selected, it will be placed and honored in the Art Gallery! You'll also get a shiny trophy for your user lookup, 10,000 neo and a random rare item!<br><Br>
							<h4>Getting Selected</h4> Kikocat selects which works will appear in the competition and it isn't so easy to be selected. When a Neopian holiday is coming up such as Easter, Krawk Day, or Jhudora Day, the Art Gallery is almost always themed around that day, so if one of those are coming up you should submit artwork related to it for a better chance! The same goes for real holidays like Valentines or St. Patrick's.<br><br> However, if you do plan to submit your art for a holiday, it's best if you submit it 2 days!! in advance. Often times the Art Gallery sets up its art the day before the actual holiday. Just another reason why it's usually not a good idea to wait till the last minute!<br><Br>

 				<div class="date-icon"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/games/aaa/trophies/2009/dd_trophies_1gold.gif"></div>
 				<div class="date-info"> The high score tables reset at around 12:10 AM NST on the 1st of each month; the first day is the easiest to get a trophy, especially in luck/chance games and games with a maximum possible score. Trophies are awarded at 8pm NST each evening. For the best chance at a trophy, send game scores between 12:01am - 7:59pm on the first of the month. <p>A few games, namely Maths Nightmare and Escape from Meridell Castle have avatars associated with them. But these avatars require you to be on the top 50 of the high score list. After scores reset night, the high score list will be at their lowest making it a great opportunity to go for it. You just need to hold your place in the top 50 until 11.50pm. This may be a good opportunity to try for other game avatars as then you may also manage a trophy at the same time though it's difficult.

					<div class="date-info"> Half Price Day is the third day of every month. The official Neopets shops price their stock at half-price, and you can haggle down further from there. Speed is of the essence on this day-- even more restockers than usual will flock to the shops to get a better price for the items and will be snapping things up faster than the younger players who tend to hobble into the shops at any ol' time. Kauvara's Magic Shop and the Post Office tend to be the most competitive.<br><br> The <a href="#hidden-tower">Hidden Tower</a> does not reduce its prices on half price day but is affected by a similar event.<br><br> You can use this shop directory (http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=shopsdirectory) to locate the best deals during Half Price day! <br><br>

This makes a big difference though when buying those really expensive items, with prices reaching in the hundred thousands or even millions of Neo!

					<div class="date-icon"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/usuki_warrior.gif"></div>
					<div class="date-info"> The <a href="/prehistoric/battleground/">Tyrannian Battleground</a> is an ongoing feature in the Battledome where you get to choose a faction to join and fight for every two weeks. At the end of each two week cycle, the Oracle awards prizes to the winning faction.<br><br><i>The Battleground is a follow-up from the War for the Obelisk event (https://www.jellyneo.net/?go=tyrannia_plot), in which six factions fought over a magical obelisk that appeared in Neopia.</i>
						<h4>Sign Ups</h4> Every other Monday, head on over to the <a href="/prehistoric/battleground/">battleground</a> to enlist yourself among the brave warriors. You have three days to sign up with your faction of choice. Each cycle, three random factions will be selected to participate in that week's battle. The prizes you receive (see the Boons section below) differ depending on your faction, so it can be more advantageous to join in depending on the available factions. <h4>Battling</h4> The fighting kicks off on the Thursday following sign ups and continues for four days. Your faction leader will help you keep track of your battles during each skirmish. In order to qualify as having helped your faction, you have to take part in at least 10 battles, regardless of difficulty. It is unknown at this time how the difficulty of the challengers affects the number of points your team receives. You can find a list of all the challengers in the JellyNeo In-Depth Battlepedia (http://battlepedia.jellyneo.net/?go=challengers&category=33). <h4>Prizes: Boons</h4> If you allied yourself with the victorious faction during a skirmish, then you will be rewarded with your choice of boon (a fancy name for "perks") to enhance the site for the duration of the week-long truce. Each faction has its own list of priorities, so not all boons are available for every faction.<br><br><b>FULL GUIDE | https://www.jellyneo.net/?go=battleground_of_the_obelisk</b>

       May the 12th - this upcoming Monday - is a very important day in Neopian history. It is Tyrannian Victory Day!

 <h1>Exploring Maraqua</h1>
		<p id="blurb">
			In a crater just to the east of the Haunted Woods lies the magical Maraqua, home to Faeries of all elements. Previously, the entire land floated 10,000 feet above Neopia on clouds and enchanted rock. The exact moment of its discovery is unknown, but it is thought that it was at some point in Year 1.

To witness the struggle between Maraqua and Captain Scarblade, check out the final chapter of the <a href="http://www.neopets.com/water/plot_com.phtml">Curse of Maraqua</a> Peace now reigns in Maraqua, and trade with the surface is flourishing again.

			<h1>Quirky Kithen Recipes</h1>
			<p id="blurb">
			This month we bring to you magical favorites from the realm of Maraqua! check out these heavenly treats and try them at home or feed them to your neopet!
			</p>
			<h2>Taste of Maraqua</h2>

   <a name="kelp"></a>
   <p id="blurb">For those of you non-Neopians, Maraqua is an underwater land within the Neopets world. I was immediately excited, because one of my favorite Neopian things is in Maraqua – Kelp, Neopia’s equivalent of a three-Michelin-starred restaurant. Even as a kid, I thought the food served at Kelp looked amazing and I always wanted to try it. Well, now that I’m an adult, I can! So I set out to create a full Kelp dinner, and then write down the recipes to share with my guild mates! <br><br> I hope you try these Neopian delicacies and have as much fun making them as I did! If you ever have questions or need help with a recipe, feel free to reach out to me! - <a href="/~athelaya#thebanditrocks">thebanditrocks</a> (Erica) <br><br></p>

        </div>
        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ul>
         <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. <br> Trim the asparagus by cutting 1” from the bottom of each stalk. Peel the potatoes and dice into quarters.</li>
         <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot, then add water <i>(enough to cover the potatoes by about 1” of water)</i>. <br> Toss in the salt, place on stove and bring to a boil. </li>
         <li>Allow potatoes to boil for 10-12 minutes, or until they are easily pierced by a fork. <br> While the potatoes are boiling, start the asparagus and the steak.</li>
         <li>Place the asparagus on the baking sheet, drizzle olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper over the asparagus, and toss to coat. <br> Spread the asparagus into one layer and roast in the oven for 10-15 minutes. </li>
         <li> Once the asparagus is in the oven and the potatoes are boiling, preheat a heavy cast iron sk1llet on the stovetop over medium-high heat for 5-10 minutes. <br> Cast iron is heavy and takes time to heat thoroughly, so handle it with caution. Once the pan is very hot, add the oil <i>(just enough to coat the bottom of the pan)</i>. </li>
         <li>Season both sides of the steaks liberally with salt and pepper, and then add them to the hot cast iron sk1llet.<br> Sear one side for 1-2 minutes, then flip over and sear the other side for about the same length of time (see note 2 below). </li>
         <li>Once both sides are seared, flip back to the side you started on, and let cook for 3-4 minutes adding 1 Tbsp of butter to the top of each steak and let melt. <br> Then flip again and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes. </li>
         <li>Finally, use tongs to stand the steak on its side and sear the edges. This should only take a minute or so. If you’re not sure about doneness, the best way to test is to use a thermometer: Medium Rare 135°F, Medium 140°F, Medium Well 145°F. <br> Once done, remove steaks to a plate and let rest for 10 minutes. </li>
         <li>Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain the water and move potatoes to a large bowl. Using a potato masher (or a large fork or a handheld electric mixer) mash the potatoes to your desired consistency. Add the butter and cream and mix well until the butter is fully melted. If desired, continue adding cream 1 Tbsp at a time until you’re satisfied with the taste and texture. </li>
         <li> To make the cranberry pan sauce, add all ingredients to the pan you just cooked the steak in, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and syrupy (about 2-3 minutes). Remove pan from the heat.</li>
         <li> To assemble, place asparagus spears in a wheel pattern, then spoon the mashed potatoes on top. Place a steak on top of the mashed potatoes, and drizzle with the pan sauce. Add a radish for garnish (optional). <br> Enjoy!</li>
        </ul>
        <uL><b> Note 1:</b> Any oil with a high smoke point is fine. Canola or vegetable oil work well, but this is not the right time for Extra Virgin Olive Oil!<br><b> Note 2:</b> It’s near impossible for me to tell you how to properly cook a steak. There are many variables, including whether you’re using a cast iron sk1llet like I used, a cast iron griddle pan, a stainless steel pan, a nonstick pan or a grill. It also depends on the thickness of your steak, and whether you let your steak sit at room temperature for 45 minutes before cooking (best practice), or if it’s been plucked straight from the fridge (that’s what I do, because I’m forgetful and don’t remember to take the steak out ahead of time…). And even then, it depends on how cold your fridge is versus mine. Not to mention that everyone has a different preference for steak doneness. To the best of my ability, this recipe is written to produce a medium-rare steak in a cast iron sk1llet on an electric stovetop using a 1” thick cut of beef tenderloin. </uL>

        <div id="reci-b"><strong>Ingredients</strong>
         <ul>
          <li> 3 cups heavy whipping cream, divided</li>
          <li> 12 ounces (2 cups) semi-sweet Chocolate chips</li>
          <li> 2 pirouette cookies (optional, for garnish)</li>
          <li> !For Chocolate Bowls</li>
          <li> 3 bags Chocolate candy melts, any colors</li>
          <li> 4 b4lloons</li>
          <li> Cooking spray</li>
         </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Chocolate Mouse : Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
         <li> Microwave 1 cup of heavy whipping cream in a large microwave safe bowl for 1 minute. Add the Chocolate chips, stir slightly. Microwave the mixture for another 30 seconds, then stir until the Chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is smooth, silky and a rich Chocolate color. Set aside to cool. </li>
         <li> In the bowl of a stand mixer <i>(or using a large bowl and hand mixer)</i> whip the remaining 2 cups cream on high speed until it is stiff. </li>
         <li> Add the whipped cream to the bowl of now-cooled Chocolate ganache, and fold gently to combine. It’s okay if there’s still some white flecks of whipped cream in your mixture – just be careful not to overmix, or the whipped cream could deflate.</li>
         <li> Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least two hours until you’re ready to serve.</li>
         <li> To serve, either transfer the mixture to a piping bag and pipe into bowls, or simply scoop the mousse with a spoon into serving bowls.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chocolate Bowls : Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
         <li> Inflate two b4lloons to your desired bowl size. Wash well, and dry thoroughly. Then, spray liberally with a nonstick cooking spray, or coat with some olive oil. Rub the b4lloon to ensure the nonstick spray is applied evenly.</li>
         <li> In a microwave-safe bowl, melt ½ a bag of Chocolate melts according to the package directions. This should be your “base color,” or whatever you want the main structure of the bowl to be. I used dark Chocolate melts.</li>
         <li> Once melted, use a silicone spatula to spread the melted Chocolate over the b4lloon to the desired height of your bowl. I recommend doing this over the sink, as it is likely to drip and cause a mess. Make sure the layer is thick enough that you can no longer see the b4lloon through the Chocolate.</li>
         <li> Place a spoonful of melted Chocolate onto parchment paper on a baking sheet. Once you are done with your base layer, place the b4lloon Chocolate-side-down onto the tray, and hold it in place for a few seconds to let it set. Move the whole tray to the fridge to chill for 15 minutes.</li>
         <li> If you are making more than one b4lloon, repeat this process with your second b4lloon while the first waits in the fridge.</li>
         <li> After the base layer of Chocolate has set, it’s time to add your accent colors. Add ¼ package of Chocolate melts (in whatever accent color you choose) to a piping bag or Ziplock (be sure to close with rubber band to prevent leaking!).</li>
         <li> Microwave until melted, and massage the bag to ensure all Chocolate melts are melted. Cut off the tip of the bag (as wide or as narrow as you wish, depending on the design you’d like). Take one of the now-cold b4lloons from the fridge, and pipe the accent color onto it in whatever pattern you choose. </li>
         <li> Once you are done, return the b4lloon to the fridge and allow to chill for another 15 minutes. Repeat this step for as many b4lloons or colors that you have.</li>
         <li> Once the Chocolate has set, remove b4lloons from fridge. Cut a very small hole in the top of the b4lloon, near the tie (you want it to deflate as slowly as possible, not pop!). Slowly peel the b4lloon away from the bowl until it is completely removed. Return bowls to fridge until you’re ready to serve.</li>

									<p>
										Elden Ring is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective and features elements similar to those found in its predecessors, the Souls series as well as Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, with gameplay focusing on combat and exploration. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki explained that players start with a linear opening but will eventually progress to freely explore the Lands Between, including its six main areas, as well as castles, fortresses, and catacombs scattered throughout the vast open-world map. These main areas are interconnected through a central hub that players can access later in the game's progression—similar to Firelink Shrine from Dark Souls—and will be explorable using the character's mount as the main mode of transport, although a fast travel system will be an available option. Throughout the game, players will encounter non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies alike, including the demigods who rule each main area and will serve as the game's main bosses.<br><br>
										Combat in Elden Ring relies heavily on character-building elements found in previous Souls games and related intellectual properties, such as calculated & close-ranged melee-based combat with the use of sk1lls, magic abilities, as well as blocking and dodging mechanics. Elden Ring will introduce mounted combat and a stealth system, the latter being a core gameplay element from Sekiro; these features are expected to encourage players in strategizing their combat approach with each unique enemy they encounter. The game will make use of a player character stamina bar after being absent from Sekiro, although its overall influence over combat was reduced compared to previous titles that utilized it. Unlike in Sekiro, resurrection mechanics after in-game death won't be available, however some elements were added to ensure players' progression within the game.<br><br>
										Miyazaki stated that the customization in Elden Ring would be richer, as players will be able to discover different sk1lls through their exploration of the map instead of unlocking sk1ll trees as in Sekiro and differing from the pre-fixed weapon sk1lls of FromSoftware's previous games. These sk1lls are interchangeable with a large variety of weapons which, alongside equipment, magic abilities, and items players can craft using materials found within the world, can be used to customize the player character. The game will also feature summoning mechanics, where players can summon a large variety of collectible spirits hidden throughout the game's world map, including previously defeated enemies, as allies to assist them in battle. Similar to the Souls series, the game's multiplayer will allow other players to be summoned for cooperative play.

										<p>
											Elden Ring’s open-world contains tons of smaller-scale side dungeons to explore and myriad secrets to discover as you zip around on your spiritual steed. However, these wide-open spaces are quite different than many of the corridor-esque zones that have previously been associated with From Software action RPGs. What does this mean? It means that yes, you can approach the challenges of the world with melee, magic, and ranged options just as you would in other From games, but you can also employ stealth as both an offensive option and a defensive choice.
										<br><br>
											Summoning spirits is a big new component to the From Software action RPG formula in Elden Ring, and these can be acquired, leveled up, and upgraded in different ways that aren’t elaborated on right now. These spirits can take many forms, but one we saw in this demo summoned a small squad of trolls, including a beefy-style tanky troll with a big club and smattering of smaller goblin/orc looking things. What do these do? Well, in addition to dishing out and damage and getting in combat, they fulfill a critical function in battle – they take the enemy’s attention. This can be super helpful in a boss battle to let you get some hits in against a foe without windows of opportunity or in the open world where you may be faced with many different enemies from different directions simultaneously.</p>
											<p>
												Acclaimed writer George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire) took to his blog to make a few comments about his role in the development of From Software’s upcoming Elden Ring. While the blog is short, the author is clear that his work on Elden Ring took place years ago, and focused on worldbuilding the fantastical realms that players will be investigating come February. In the blog, Martin comments that video games aren’t really his thing – but then goes on to say he played some old-school strategy games like Master of Orion, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Railroad Tycoon. Apparently Martin has some excellent taste with the games he chose to play back in the day!

									<p>
							This year's Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival may not have been the joyous gathering of fans that it has been in years past, but the move from an in-person event to a digital livestream still delivered plenty of surprises and excitement. The focus was intently on the forthcoming Endwalker expansion pack, which was announced to have a November 23 release date. (Now December 7th)<br><br>Final Fantasy XIV’s 24 million registered players weave a tale of hard-fought success considering the original game’s shaky release before the reupholstered A Realm Reborn launch. Since then, Eorzea has grown with multiple expansions: Heavensward, Stormblood, and Shadowbringers, each introducing new areas to explore, more character jobs, and exciting story beats to bolster the already compelling central narrative. Endwalker is the next large-scale addition. The pandemic affected the fourth expansion’s production, and now producer and director Naoki Yoshida has announced a short two-week delay.<br><br>Endwalker is brimming with most of the feature sets and additions you'd expect from an expansion of this ilk. The level cap is increasing from 80 to 90, which will be put to good use in new dungeons and raids, and there are plenty of new bosses to face, including Anima and the Magus Sisters. Numerous new features have also including but not limited to new role quests for tanks, healers, melee DPS, physical ranged DPS, magical ranged DPS, Reaper, and Sage classes, new raids with Normal and Savage difficulty settings set for later patches, another treasure hunt dungeon and housing area with bigger purchasable plots, 5v5 PVP with ranked seasons, and small-scale quality of life tweaks including UI changes.

									<p>
										As previously mentioned, Animal Crossing: New Horizons' version 2.0 update will see the long-awaited arrival of Brewster and his coffee shop The Roost. This new shop is part of the museum and will let players enjoy fresh-brewed coffee alone or with some friends. The villagers on your island will come to the shop as well, and you can invite specific villagers via amiibo cards or figures.<br><br> Long-time fans of Animal Crossing will be happy to know that Brewster isn't the only returning villager who is part of this update, as it will also see such others as Kapp'n, Katrina, Tortimer, Harriet, Wardell, and more make their way to New Horizons.<br><br> Kapp'n and his beautiful voice will invite you on his boat for a journey to various new and mysterious islands that only he knows of. Each could have a different season, time of day, or weather than your own island, and many will have "mysterious flora" and other surprises. <br><br> As for the other villagers, these wonderful animals will be found on Harv's Island, which is also getting a big upgrade. His island will be the home to a new plaza that features all sorts of shops waiting to be built with the right amount of Bells. Once built, familiar merchants like Sahara, Kicks, Reese, and Cyrus will open up a new place to do business alongside returning favorites like Katrina and her fortune shop, Harriet and her hair-styling shop (with new hair styles!), and Tortimer and his storage solution. <br><br> Your Island will also get some new activities like Group Stretching at the plaza. This is an activity you can do with your fellow villagers or friends, and the stretching can be done with buttons or by using motion controls. <br><br> Island Ordinances are also being added, and they will let you enact such changes to your island like keeping shops open later or increasing the number of Bells you receive when selling items. The full list of ordinances includes the Beautiful Island Ordinance, Early Bird Ordinance, Night Owl Ordinance, and Bell Boom Ordinance. <br><br> Players will also be able to change the exterior look of their home, home storage has been expanded from 2,400 to 5,000, and lighting and ceiling decor can now be added to house interiors with a new Pro Decorating License. Nine new fence options are being added, players can add two more bridges or inclines to their island, and ABDs (Animal Crossing's ATMs) and storage sheds can be placed most anywhere on an island to give easy access to Bells and your items. <br><br> Those who love cooking are in for a treat as players will be able to combine ingredients to make meals like Minestrone or Pizza to display on any table or serve at a feast. Ingredients like tomatoes, wheat, sugarcane, potatoes, and carrots can also be grown to use in recipes! <br><br> Gyroids are another big addition in version 2.0 and can now be found on player's islands. Players will be able to find Gyroid fragments underground and, when planted and watered, they will turn into a Gyroid overnight. There are many types of Gyroids and many come with a unique look, sound, and animation. They can also be customized. <br><br> Other updates include an update to the Pro Camera App that lets players take photos from eye-level view, 11 new reactions, 12 more songs from K.K. Slider, new permanent ladder kits to place around the island, the ability to navigate tight spaces in your home, the apparent addition of Froggy Chair (!), and much more. <br><br> Animal Crossing: New Horizons' version 2.0 update will be the final major free update for the game that was released in March 2020.
										</p>
									<h4>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Happy Home Paradise Paid DLC</h4><b> Lets You Build Villager's Dream Homes!</b><br> Alongside Animal Crossing: New Horizon's version 2.0 update, November 5 will also see the release of the paid Happy Home Paradise DLC for players who wish to spend $24.99 USD or who are subscribed to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. <br><br> Happy Home Paradise can be accessed by flying from the island's airport to a new archipelago that is the home to Paradise Planning. This company's mission is to build the dream vacation homes for villagers around the world and they need your help. <br><br> There will be characters on the island that will have various requests, including one who loves mushrooms, another who loves arcades, and yet another who loves teddy bears. Once you accept a request, you will be able to pick an island that suits their style, and can pick the weather, time of day, and season to also help fit the mood. <br><br> There will be designated furniture and items that need to be used, but an ever-expanding catalog of items will also be available to help complete the home's interior and exterior. The homes can be moved around, trees, fencing, and paths can be added to the yard, lighting and accent walls can be added, and much more. <br><br> As you complete more and more requests, you will unlock more techniques that will let you improve your designs. These include different colored lighting, the ability to modify a home's width of length, the use of partition walls, the option to add pillars that support the ceiling and counters with different heights, soundscapes, and furniture polishing. Polishing will add certain effects to furniture like sparkling stars or flying butterflies. <br><br> As you learn these new techniques, you will be able to revisit old homes you've worked on to remodel them and utilize any sk1lls you've unlocked. <br><br> You will also be compensated for your work in Happy Home Paradise with Poki. This currency can be traded in for rare items that can only be found on this archipelago but can be brought home with you. Speaking of home, all the techniques you've learned - except for expanding the size of houses or rooms - can be used on your own home. Furthermore, the ability to remodel your neighbors' houses can also be unlocked. If you wish, you can even design a dream home for one of your favorite neighbors on the archipelago. <br><br> amiibo figures and cards can be used to invite clients of your choosing to Paradise Planning so you can build their dream homes as well. This means you can design homes for Isabelle, Timmy and Tommy, and many more. Speaking of amiibo cards, Animal Crossing Series 5 amiibo cards will also be launching on November 5 with 48 characters total. These cards also give a glimpse at some of the new Villagers that will be joining Animal Crossing: New Horizons and will be available to live on your Island. <br><br> That's not all, however, as the island Paradise Planning is located on has various facilities that are just waiting to be designed. This means you can also design your own school, hospital, restaurant, and more. <br><br> Everything you design will be recorded in the new Happy Home Network App on your NookPhone. From there, you can keep track of what you've done, share your work with others, or follow other creators for inspiration. <br><br> If you aren't ready to purchase Happy Home Paradise, friends are able to gift items acquired on the new archipelago to those who don't have the DLC. Also, many of the new techniques that are featured in Happy Home Paradise, including adding ceiling decor, lighting, accent walls, and using patterns for flooring and wallpaper are available to all as part of the Version 2.0 update. <h4>The Beginning of the End for Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h4> While Animal Crossing: New Horizons will continue to live on for many years to come with its seasonal events and the ever-evolving lives of the player and the villagers who call the island home, Nintendo has no more plans to add anything major to the game following the version 2.0 update and the Happy Home Paradise paid DLC. <br><br> Happy Home Paradise! will be the first and only paid DLC expansion for the game and will hopefully add countless hours of enjoyment for the latest entry in the long-running franchise that has sold over 33 million units since its launch in 2020. <br><br> Since then, Animal Crossing fans have participated in the infamous Bunny Day event, have seen the addition of ocean swimming, Dream Islands, fireworks, Mario-themed items, and so much more. <br><br> It will also forever be remembered as a game that helped many through the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic by giving them an opportunity to hang out with friends and loved ones while quarantined from the actual world. <br><br> If all of these updates sound like something you'd like to try and you have or are planning on purchasing the Nintendo Switch - OLED Model, be sure to check out our guide so you can safely transfer your Island and all its data to your new system. <i>Brought to you by Adam Bankhurst, IGN)</i>

									<p>
							Upcoming remakes to the first Nintendo DS Pokémon games, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl from ILCA are two of the biggest releases set for Nintendo’s holiday lineup. With just over a month until their expected release on November 19, we were allowed to go eyes-on the games in a preview event. We got a glimpse at what’s staying the same in these updated games and which modern conveniences are added to the Sinnoh adventure.<br><br> Our demonstration began with a look at the world, which remains faithful to the vision of the original Diamond and Pearl. The camera remains overhead, and the characters populating Sinnoh are presented in chibi models. However, everything has been remade with 3D models, with new textures and all, which we had known since the initial trailer some months ago. What is new about wandering the routes from town to town is the option to let one of your Pokémon companions stroll behind you at all times. It’s a cool feature from Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee and the Sword and Shield Isle of Armor DLC that I’m very happy to see return. <br><br>If you want more Pokémon from your party out and about, head to Amity Square. It’s a location that allows predetermined “cute” Pokémon to spread out around the park, causing a sort of hide-and-seek game to play out. Your monsters will find items around the area, and as you find each one, they’ll begin to follow you wherever you roam in Amity Square. With more than one member of your party at your side, the developers allow you to have a little bit of fun by adding a zoom function to the in-game camera so you can snap pictures with your partners. Bring all of your favorites (deemed cute by the Amity Square front desk attendant, of course) and make some memories.<br><br>Speaking of cute, the Pokémon Super Contest Shows return as well. Super Contests are a way to compete in different categories, including Cuteness, Toughness, Coolness, and more. You’ll play a simple rhythm game during the competitions and try to unleash a pre-chosen move from your Pokémon at the perfect time to wow the judges. You’ll also be able to see the fruits of your b4ll Capsule customization. With b4ll Capsules, you can add stickers to specific Pokéb4lls, creating unique animations and flourishes whenever you bring that Pokémon out. I saw a combination of flames and water effects applied to one of the Pokémon our demoist brought out. Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will have over 90 of these stickers, and some can be earned by winning the Super Contest Shows.<br><br>Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl aren’t going to be completely faithful to the originals, as the remakes are bringing in some well-tested features from the most recent mainline games. First, Pokémon battles use the full 3D models you’d expect to see in Sword and Shield. Your trainer is also given a full-sized model so that you can show off your character’s outfits in battle. EXP Share is applied to all Pokémon in your party when a battle concludes. However, it was confirmed that it’s not a feature that can be turned off this time around. Other quality of life additions like autosaves and seeing move effectiveness on your attacks also return. <br><br> A big question going into these remakes was whether Hidden Machines made the cut since they’re in a very different state in the modern Pokémon games. This time around, winning Gym badges will unlock HM moves that can be used in the world, but you do not have to teach them to your Pokémon. Using an HM like Strength to move a boulder will make a wild Pokémon appear and use the move for you. It doesn’t really make sense, but I’ll take the convenience over wasting precious move slots. You can call on these helpful wild monsters using the new and improved Pokétch, the watch-like device from Diamond and Pearl, which is now more like a modern smartwa.tch. Apps on this new Pokétch include a step counter, Pokémon friend checker, a calculator, an item dowsing machine, and a drawing pad.

									<p>
							<i>Demon Slayer: The Video Game is being developed by CyberConnect2, the studio behind the prolific Naruto fighting game franchise and Dragonb4ll Z: Kakarot. If you take a look at the gameplay footage above, you can get a better understanding of how in-game battles will play out. A tag battle mode is also being planned, where you’ll be able to compete against the AI or other players using various character combinations. The classic Ultimate Ninja Storm formula is on display – choose a character and select an arena to fight in. Flashy combos and swift evasion mechanics that employ the beautiful art style from the anime help give the game its extra visual flair. And, of course, there are some pretty cool finisher cinematics too; Nezuko’s is particularly impressive. <br><br>But what of the story, and how will it fit into the expansive Demon Slayer universe? A single player campaign has been confirmed and will primarily follow the events from the first season. This means that you’ll be able to relive some of the series’ most tantalizing conflicts - from the Tsuzumi Mansion arc to Tanjiro’s fateful encounter with Rui. While I was hoping for an enticing sandbox to roam around in (a guy’s gotta dream, right?), I am excited to see how the anime/manga story beats transfer over. <br><br>A lesser-known “asymmetrical survival action game” for mobile devices called Demon Slayer: Blood-Stench Blade Royale was also delayed indefinitely to give the dev team (completely separate from CyberConnect2) more time to polish the project. Details surrounding this title are scarce, but the fact that Demon Slayer will be soon be playable on the small and big screen is testament to its relevance. ((JASON GUISAO, GAMEINFORMER)) </i><br><br><b>The Hinokami Chronicles is a spectacular arena fighter from the team at CyberConnect2 that lets players relive the memorable moments of “Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc” and “Mugen Train Arc”. Follow Tanjiro through the story from the “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba” anime as he faces demons in order to turn his sister Nezuko, who has become a demon, back into a human. Players can expect: • Exhilarating Arena Battles – Master the multitude of spectacular sk1lls of a wide roster of characters from the anime, including Tanjiro and Nezuko, to overcome challengers in head - to - head battle, locally and online. • Moving Drama – Take up the sword of Tanjiro Kamado and guide his journey to become a Demon Slayer and turn his sister Nezuko back into a human. • Thrilling Boss Battles – Action and drama reach their peak in specially designed battles against powerful demons that will test Tanjiro's mettle. • Original Anime Voice Cast – The original English and Japanese casts of the anime return to bring their authentic portrayals to the game.</b>

									<p>
							The humor. The rock ’n roll attitude. Groot being Groot. Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy looks to be every bit as fun and wild as the motion picture and comic book counterparts. We all thought it would be a multiplayer game when it was announced, but Eidos-Montréal’s decision to make it a single-player experience that puts you into the head of Star-Lord makes it all the more intriguing. As the leader of the team, you are tasked to make difficult decisions that affect both the story and your standing with the Guardians in big ways. I can’t wait to see how those choices play out. The combat also looks as chaotic as I’d hoped with razor-sharp melee strikes blending with death being rained down by heavy, sci-fi weaponry. Every aspect of the game looks joyous and crazy and that’s exactly what I want from this awesome superhero team. <br><br> You are Star-Lord, so nothing’s off-limits with your bold combat style, from Element Blasters and jet boot-powered dropkicks to tag-team beat-downs. With the Guardians fighting at your side, call the shots and overwhelm your opponents with signature attacks. Meanwhile, the consequences of your decisions will range from light-hearted to downright unexpected as your journey unfolds.<br><br>Your newly-formed band of legendary misfits is set to save the universe in this fresh but faithful take on the Guardians of the Galaxy. Somehow, you set off a chain of catastrophic events, leading to a wild ride through mind-blowing worlds inhabited by iconic and original Marvel characters.

									<p>
							Astria Ascending caught our attention when it was unveiled in March for its gorgeous hand-drawn visuals. French-Canadian developer Artisan Studios, who created the Super Neptunia RPG, enlisted plenty of JRPG talent to help them create the game.The story is written by Kazushige Nojima, best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series, spanning from VII all the way to today with XV and VII Remake. Composer Hitoshi Sakimoto, who provided memorable scores for Final Fantasy XII, Vagrant Story, and Valkyria Chronicles, is behind the music. While the art comes from Akihiko Yoshida, the main character designer on Nier: Automata and Bravely Default, and Hideo Minaba, who was a primary art lead on Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy’s IX and XIV.The RPG’s beauty and exciting talent speak for themselves, but how does it play? With just about a month out from launch, Alex Stadnik and I recently went hands-on with the game to find out, playing through its first few hours. It's certainly taking plenty of cues from Square Enix's Bravely Default series, putting an emphasis on using your turns wisely, maximizing the potential of your party members’ job abilities, and having elemental strengths and weaknesses integral to your success.Join us in the latest New Gameplay as we dissect how that works to Astria Ascending's advantage, while we also discuss what we find promising and where we have concerns. Get ready to see some dungeons, turn-based combat, and a big boss fight for good measure!

									<p>
							With our five senses, we perceive a great deal of the world around us. But what if another world exists behind the one we see? What if a second reality sits just behind the façade of our experiences? And, what if this reality is full of spirits we cannot see and cannot touch, who brush past us on a daily basis? Bloober Team attempts to explore this mysterious spirit realm with its puzzle-filled horror adventure, The Medium. Sadly, Bloober Team’s vision for an unseen reality isn’t that exciting to look at.<br><br>Marianne is a supernatural medium who can talk to the dead, but when she receives a mysterious phone call summoning her to a derelict hotel on the outskirts of Kraków, Poland, her talents are truly tested. When Marianne arrives at the resort, the only inhabitants she encounters are tormented lost souls and an invisible monster who forces Marianne to wrestle with her past. The Medium’s narrative starts with a lot of promise, but quickly loses steam. Marianne doesn’t have much of a personality, and is little more than a cipher to move the plot along. Moreover, certain details are hard to follow, and The Medium's few interesting twists (near the end of the game) feel unearned. <i> (Ben Reeves, GameInformer // Rated 6.5/10)</i>

									<p>
							Lost in Random by Zoink, the makers of Fe, is a promising-looking EA Originals title we’ve been waiting to get our hands on since it was announced last summer. Today’s EA Play presentation treated us to a new gameplay breakdown of the game’s unique combat and also finally pulled the curtain back on a release date. <br><br>On September 10, you can guide a young girl named Even on a quest to rescue her captive sister, Odd. She’s joined by Dicey, a living dice, as they explore the Kingdom of Random. An evil queen reigns over this dark fairytale world, which is divided into six realms governed by a cursed black dice. <br><br> At its core, Lost in Random is a third-person action-adventure title but combat takes the form of flashy dice battles that unfold in board game-like arenas. By collecting coins, players can trade them to purchase cards that grant new attacks, abilities, and more. For example, one card causes Dicey to explode on contact with enemies. Another card transforms him into a giant hammer. Other cards can afflict enemies with curses and spawn traps in the environment.<br><br> Even herself can drop baddies using a slingshot. She can also knock off energy cubes that fuel Dicey. When Dicey’s at full power, he can unleash a time-freezing spell that brings enemies to a halt, giving you a temporary window to unleash the power of randomness.<br><br> Lost in Random’s Tim Burton-esque vibe combined with its unique tactical combat has all the potential of a gem in the making. It was recently honored as part of the Tribeca Film Festival’s first official games selection, so it’s already doing something right. We’ll find out once we get our hands on it when it launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. <br><br>
									<h6>A Twisted Fairytale</h6> <i>Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Random, there lived a mad Queen who controlled a mysterious black dice. By her decree, every child of Random would be given the honor of rolling the dice on their twelfth birthday to determine which realm of the kingdom they belonged to, thereby deciding their fate for all eternity. Roll a one and the child would be sent to Onecroft, destined to live a life of struggle. Roll a three and land in Threedom, a chaotic realm destroyed by civil war. Roll a six, and they would live a life of luxury in the Queen’s dark palace. Or so it was told… <br><br> One day, two devoted sisters from Onecroft named Even and Odd, were cruelly separated by a throw of the dice. For on Odd’s twelfth birthday, she rolled a six. How marvelous! Despite this seemingly fortuitous news, Even was heartbroken at the loss of her sister.<br><br>Just one year after her sister was taken, Even received a strange signal. Was Odd in danger? Determined to find out, she followed the signal to a mysterious place – the Valley of Dice.<br><br>There, Even discovered something that had been forbidden to the citizens of Random for as long as time could remember – a living, breathing dice. Despite the danger of being caught with such a companion, Even decided to make the charming creature her own, naming him Dicey.<br><br>But, to Even’s surprise, beneath Dicey’s gentle exterior was the power to alter the world around them and even time itself, triggering a fantastical adventure that would take them across all six realms of Random. Along the way they would meet many strange citizens, embark on courageous quests, and battle disturbing enemies in their mission to uncover a dark and twisted secret.</i>

									<strong class="bord">Darwin's Game</strong>
									<b> Genres: Drama, Action, Horror </b> | If you were to cross Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman's adrenaline-charged social thriller Nerve with the mystery-driven ultra-violence of Hiroya Oku's Gantz, it'd probably look something like Darwin's Game. Based on artist "Ginko" and writer Yuki Takahata's manga of the same name, the anime centers on 17-year-old Kaname Sudō, who, after accepting an mysterious invite from a recently deceased friend, is thrust into a deadly supernatural bloodsport known only as Darwin's Game. Pitted against a cadre of sociopaths and with no way to seek help from the outside world, Kaname must rely on his wits and will to survive while searching for a means to escape this living nightmare. Produced by studio Nexus, the 11-episode series is penned entirely by series author Yuki Takahata, resulting in an adaptation that's a near one-to-one match with the source material. If you're looking for a taut action series with serious mystery drama, Darwin's Game is a solid choice. -Rated 10/10- (Fun.)

									<strong class="bord">Pet</strong>
									<b> Genres: Creepy, Psychedelic, Drama </b> | Pet is a real mindscrew, in more ways than one. Based on Ranjō Miyake's manga of the same name, the series follows Tsukasa and Hitomi, two empaths with the ability to delve inside the minds of others and manipulate their memories and perceptions. Employed by a shadowy organization known simply as "The Company," the pair are tasked with using their abilities to cover up crimes, assassinations, and commit all sorts of unsavory acts, more often than not at the expense of innocent lives and their own fractured psyches. The dialogue can be frustratingly obtuse at times, with crucial terms like "peaks" and "valleys" thrown out of left field with little if any formal explanation, and the initial episodes can be a bit hard to follow with regard to what is being seen or perceived by whom at any given moment. Hang in there, though -- it's a story that gradually makes more sense the longer it goes on and rewards the closer you pay attention. And barring even that, it's still worth a watch for the psychedelic visuals alone. Think of it as a more freakish take on Christopher Nolan's Inception by way of Philip K. Dick's Ubik. - Rated 8/10 - </i> (Prime)

									<strong class="bord">Somali and the Forest Spirit</strong>
									<b> Genres: Drama, Fantasy </b> | If your tastes veer more towards the whimsical fare of Studio Ghibli than explicitly action-oriented titles, Somali and the Forest Spirit is a perfect choice. Set in a world of magic and sorcery populated by spirits, goblins, and all sorts of creatures, the series follows the journey of a forest-protecting golem and their companion, a precocious child named Somali. Together, the two embark on a search for a home for Somali among the last of the humans, a race of beings previously thought to have been persecuted and hunted to the brink of extinction ages ago. Think Alphonse and Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist, but instead of two brothers in search of the philosopher's stone to restore their bodies, it's a father figure and their adoptive ward searching for safety and security in a world of dangers at every turn. With exquisite backgrounds, disarming humor, and a story with genuine emotional pull, Somali and the Forest Spirit is a spirited fable of parenthood and love found in the most unlikely of circu.mstances.

									<strong class="bord">In/Spectre</strong>
									<b> Genres: Fantasy, Action, Family</b> | Supernatural mystery series are a dime a dozen when it comes to anime, so it’s refreshing when one comes along that has as intriguing a premise and personality as In/Spectre. Based on Kyo Shirodaira’s novel series, In/Spectre follows 15-year-old Iwanaga Kotoko, a university student who four years prior to the series’s start was anointed as the "Goddess of Wisdom" of the spirit world at the cost of her left leg and right eye. Acting as an intermediary between the human and spirit world, Kotoko is tasked with solving disputes and discrepancies between the two. There’s just one problem: Kuro Sakuragawa, Kotoko’s fast-made companion and boyfriend, is a surprisingly fearsome entity with mysterious powers that strike fear in the spirits who Kotoko is charged with protecting. A serial mystery crossed with an odd-couple rom-com that occasionally pokes at the fourth wall, In/Spectre is a gorgeously animated series with fun twists, delightful characters, and engrossing cases that'll keep you hooked to the end.

									<strong class="bord">Kaguya-sama: Love is War </strong>
									<b> Genres: Romance, Action, Comedy, Drama</b> | Student council president Miyuki Shirogane and vice president Kaguya Shinomiya return for another season of machiavellian shenanigans and romantic hijinks! The first season of Kaguya-sama: Love is War was one of last year’s standout new series, a devious and hilarious twist on the classic ‘will-they-won’t-they’ formula of high school rom-com anime. Season 2 has even more in the way of lovestruck mishaps between Miyuki and Kaguya, as well as more time spotlighting old and new breakout favorites such as the Kaguya's hyper-capable assistant Ai Hayasaki and Miyuki’s icy cool sister Kei. And better, the second season is just self-contained enough that viewers new to the series could pop in to watch this one without missing a beat. Kaguya-sama: Love is War is uproariously hilarious, stylistically inventive, and easily one of the best anime rom-coms to come out this year. (Fun.)

									<b> Genres: Comedy, Drama, Action</b> | Makoto Edamura is Japan's greatest con-man. Or at least, that's what he thinks until he's bested by Laurent Thierry, a suave and masterful gentleman thief who eyes up the young Edamura to join his globe-trotting crew as his apprentice. Traveling the world from San Francisco to Singapore, London and beyond, Edamura learns the tricks of the trade as he cons the criminal elite's most dastardly plutocrats while growing up along the way, all tinged with the same sense of humor that you'd find in any of the Ocean's movies. Directed by Hiro Kaburagi (91 Days, Speed Grapher) and written by screenwriter Ryota Kosawa, Great Pretender is a death-defying, high-wire heist drama packed with a dazzling art design, beautiful vistas, and an infectiously jazzy score (Nflix)

									<strong class="bord">Dorohedoro</strong>
									<b> Genres: Action, Comedy, Violence, Drama </b> | Based on Q Hayashida’s cult dark fantasy sci-fi manga of the same name, Dorohedoro is set in the Hole, a harsh derelict metropolis populated by humans and an ever-increasing number of unfortunate souls transformed into chimeric monstrosities by malicious sorcerers from another dimension. The series follows Caiman, an amnesiac bounty hunter and his best friend Nikaido as they scour the depths of the Hole in search of the sorcerer who cursed him with a lizard’s head. Oh yeah, he’s also got a sentient human head at the back of his throat that pops up Xenomorph-style whenever Caiman swallows his prey to search for the culprit. It only gets weirder from there. Packed to the brim with gnarly violence, leather-clad weirdos, pitch-black humor, and more than a few moments of light-hearted levity, Dorohedoro is a dark and impressive hybrid-CG anime that combines dystopian body-horror and slice-of-life comedy to make for one of the most exciting and unique new series to come out in 2020.

							<h4>10.21: More HTML5 Games & Maps</h4> It's been 78 days since the last beta site redesign, and a new release—v0.4.8—is now live!<br>
							<br>
							<b>1) Three more games receive HTML5 versions.</b> This round includes:<br>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li><a href="/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1397">Alien Aisha Vender Machine</a></li>
								<li><a href="/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1395">Faerie Bubbles</a></li>
								<li><a href="/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1396">Ultimate Bullseye II</a></li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<s>As of writing, you cannot earn any NP from these 3 games just yet. We assume TNT is holding back on that for some live testing just to make sure there aren't any big issues.</s> As of November 22nd, score submissions for Neopoints have been enabled!<br>
							<br> Faerie Bubbles has a known issue where the blaster will still give you coloured bubbles that are not currently on the board (something the Flash version did not do). This makes it quite challenging to progress:<br>
							<br>
							<blockquote>The Faerie Bubbles Game has a balancing issue where colours not remaining in-game will show up to shoot, making the levels very difficult to pass. We are working to address this issue ASAP.</blockquote>
							<br>
							<b>2) Seven more world maps have been converted to HTML5.</b> This map conversion update includes:<br>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li><a href="/objects.phtml">Neopia Central</a></li>
								<li><a href="/market_bazaar.phtml">Neopian Bazaar</a></li>

								<li><a href="/winter/icecaves.phtml">The Ice Caves</a></li>
								<li><a href="/winter/terrormountain.phtml">Top of Terror Mountain</a></li>
							</ul>
							<br> Oddly, <a href="/altador/index.phtml">Altador</a> is included in the list as well (making it 8 maps), but the Altador map was previously converted in 2018. It seems to have gotten another update, probably to bring it in line with the newer maps.<br>
							<br>
							<b>3) Finally, Random Events make a return in the beta layout.</b> Previously, Random Events did not work on pages with the new layout and could only be received on the legacy site. No longer!<br>
							<br>
							<div class="text-center"><img src="https://imgur.com/6Fw72QR.png" class="img-screenshot"></div>
							<br>
							<b>What's coming up?</b><br> Pet Slots are still in the works, and TNT is aiming to have them for a holiday release. (Note that UCs are <em>not</em> part of the Pet Slots update, and will come later.) The Advent Calendar is also getting the new layout treatment in time for December 1st. More HTML5 map updates will be coming, as well.<br>

							<h4>08.27 : Pet Slots + Premium Sale + Charity Corner</h4>
							<center><img src="https://imgur.com/xmSbtAR.gif" style="width:20%;float:right;"></center>
							<br> Big updates were posted in this week's <a href="/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&issue=943">Neopian Times Editorial</a>! Perhaps one of the most exciting editorials in a long while. Here's a high level summary:<br>
							<strong class="bord">Annual Premium Sale</strong> It's late, but it's coming next week, so get ready! Not much else to say about this one other than nice to see confirmation. We expect it will be the usual $49.95 yearly sale price. If you're interested in Premium and would like an overview check out our Premium guide:<br>
							<br>
							<center><i>http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=premium</i></center>
							<strong class="bord">Charity Corner</strong> Long story short, no Charity Corner in 2021. They are taking the time to focus on other things&mdash;namely Pet Slots. They will also be adding a new TNT member soon to take a look at recurring events:<br>
							<br>
							<blockquote>We will soon be getting a new member of the team who will be taking a look at many of our events to see how to improve them and Charity Corner will be one of those, so hold on to your donations and Granny Hopbobbin will see you soon.</blockquote>
							<strong class="bord">Pet Slots!</strong> The big news this week is, additional pet slots are coming soon!<br>
							<br>
							<center><img src="https://images.neopets.com/items/mall_petslots_1.gif" style="margin:3px;"><img src="https://images.neopets.com/items/mall_petslots_5.gif" style="margin:3px;"><img src="https://images.neopets.com/items/mall_petslots_10.gif" style="margin:3px;"></center>
							<br> In total, you will be able to add +10 new Pet Slots to your account. In addition, Premium members will be receiving +3 pet slots as part of their membership. That means, after Pet Slots are released:<br>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Premium users will have 10 total pet slots, plus the ability to purchase up to 10 more, for a total of 20 slots.</li>
								<li>Non-Premium users will have 6 total pet slots, plus the ability to purchase up to 10 more, for a total of 16 slots.</li>
							</ul>
							<br> Pet Slots will be purchasable in the NC Mall. The prices are currently unknown.<br>
							<br> There is currently no release date for Pet Slots (it's still in progress), but with all of this information being released, we imagine TNT is relatively close to having something for us soon!<br>
							<br> In the process, dealing with your +4 extra pet slots when you cancel your Premium membership will receive some tweaks:<br>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>When you cancel Premium, you still need to choose which Neopets will go away if you have more Neopets than slots (more than the free 6 slots plus whatever you purchased&mdash;in essence, the Neopets taking up your +4 free Premium slots).</li>
								<li>The 90-day window to reclaim your Neopets will go away. Instead, your Neopets will be sent to an "idle" limbo indefinitely until you renew Premium or purchase more Pet Slots.</li>
								<li>To get your Neopets out of limbo, you will need to renew Premium or purchase more pet slots (up to the allowed 16 non-Premium slots) to get them back.</li>
							</ul>
							<br> With this change, Transfer Limits in the Pound will also be temporarily lifted. This is so you will have easy ways to consolidate Neopets from your side accounts if you so wish to. TNT will confirm when those limits are being lifted, and when they will return. The ability to transfer Lutaris is also on the table! (But TNT hasn't confirmed this will definitely happen.)<br>
							<br> And that's about it! We encourage you to read the full editorial here:<br>

							<h4>08.04 : More Converted Pages + Coming Soon</h4> A new update to the Neopets site redesign&mdash;v0.4.7&mdash;is now live! <br>
							<strong class="bord">1) A bunch of dailies and quest pages have been converted.</strong> <i>Nothing new, just a bunch more sections on some high-traffic areas have been brought into the new layout:</i><br>

							<strong class="bord">What's coming up?</strong> HTML5 maps are coming soon&mdash;or so TNT says. There are also some new HTML5 games in the works. Faerie Bubbles has been confirmed to be one of the next releases there!<br>
							<br> TNT has also posted that more information about additional pet slots should be forthcoming soon. Hopefully it's something we get to see by the end of August.<br>
							<br> Lastly, a big update about streamlining beta releases and a new community manager was announced:<br>
							<br>
							<blockquote>It's been a while since there's been a new beta update and Altador Cup had a lot to do with that. We're making a lot of changes internally to ensure that we get more frequent updates in a more consistent pace. We will also be communicating more frequently with the community about upcoming releases and plans with the help of our new Community Manager, who we will be introducing soon. Thank you for all your continued support!</blockquote>
							<br>
							<strong class="bord">August 5th Addendum:</strong> Another update was added in, talking about improvements to the Customisation page:<br>
							<br>
							<blockquote>At long last, updates to Customisation are here that will drastically improve your experience with the feature! Loading times have been improved. An issue of Neopets not showing up in thumbnails is fixed. The only caveat to this is that UC Pets still need to undergo some fixes, but these issues will be addressed prior to the re-release of UC Pets.<br>
								<br> If there are any further issues with Customisation (surrounding the page itself and not individual items), please reach out to our Customer Support with as much information as you can provide, including your username, number of pets, closet size, browser, and what you are experiencing.<br>
								<br> Please note that our recommended closet size is 650 items! If you have more than 2.5K items in your closet, you may want to move some to your Safety Deposit Box in order to improve loading times in Customisation.
							</blockquote>
							<br> If you're still having issues with the Customisation app itself, you should reach out to <a href="https://www.jumpstart.com/support/np-classic">Neopets support</a>.<br>

							<h4>05.30 : New Layout + NC Mall Updates</h4>
							<li>Updates slowed down a bit due to the Festival of Neggs and Altador Cup.</li>
							<li> After the AC finishes, the team will be swinging back to the site redesign.</li>
							<li> Next big release will be a big customization app fix. (Noted the issues with people loading the closet and items.)</li>
							<li> After that, the NC Mall will be getting a revamp, and included will be UC Neopets! *party* (Price, and exact details not mentioned—temper your expectations!)</li>
							<li> Aiming to keep UC pets still valuable, but far more accessible. (See our List of UC Neopets in the Image Emporium.)</li>
							<li> Pet Slots will also be purchasable in the NC Mall in the update. (Again, exact details, price, limits, etc. not announced.) </li>
							<h4>05.12 : Site Search, Create-a-Pet, and More Converted Pages!</h4> A new update to the Neopets site redesign—v0.4.6—is now live! And at long last... a full 91 days since the last beta update. This update contains a number of changes.<br><br><strong>1) Site search now lives in the new layout.</strong> Just click the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner to initiate a search box, and then search for any keywords you like. For example, "codestone":<br><br>

							<br><strong>4) Various quest-givers have been moved to the new layout.</strong> Including Illusen, Jhudora, the Island Chef, the Brain Tree, and the Snow Faerie.<br><br> More importantly, the Island Chef will now only award stat bonuses <em>to your active Neopet</em>. (Cue the rejoicing from those training their Neopet.)<br><br><strong>5) Lastly, the Tyrannian site theme is now available in the new layout.</strong> To enable this new theme on redesigned pages, you need to choose it from the "Beta Theme" dropdown list on the <a href="/preferences.phtml">Site Preferences</a> page.<br><br> This site theme is a default theme, so you need to take no action to permanently unlock it.<br><br>

							<br> There are also a few other minor bug fixes, along with the addition of a few non-Flash games to the <a href="/games/">new Games Room</a>.<br><b>See Neopets official updates and news coverage in the <a href="/releasenotes/">Relese Notes</a>. <br>~ <i>Posted by 'Dave' @JellyNeo</i>
								<h4>02.15 : Site Redesign: A Few Bug Fixes // Posted by Dave @JellyNeo</h4> A new update to the Neopets site redesign—v0.4.5—is now live! This update contains a few new items and a theme:<br><br><strong>1) The Valentine's Day theme makes its redesigned debut.</strong> It's bright pink, filled with Chocolate, and has more hearts than you can count—fitting for a Valentine's theme:<br><br>
							</b>
							<center><img src="http://imgur.com/0LC83kG.png" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></center>
							<br> This theme is available to all Neopians during the beta period, but in order to keep the new theme you will need to either (a) already have it unlocked on the Classic site, or (b) send a Mysterious Valentines Day Card on February 14th to a Neopian who doesn't have the theme yet. See our Site Themes guide (http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=sitethemes#valentines) for full details.<br><br> To enable this new theme on redesigned pages, you need to choose it from the "Beta Theme" dropdown list on the <a href="/preferences.phtml">Site Preferences</a> page.<br><br><strong>2) A ticking clock has returned to the top right corner.</strong> A staple since the very first Neopets layout redesign has returned.<br><br>
							<center><img src="http://imgur.com/TG2iQ4r.gif" style="width: 50%; padding: 10px;"></center>
							<br><strong>3) The Wheel of Monotony has been de-Flashed.</strong> And alongside the longest spinning wheel, all wheels now have sound effects added back in.<br><br>
							<center>
								<a href="/prehistoric/monotony/monotony.phtml">Spin the Wheel of Monotony »</a>
							</center>
							<br><br><strong>4) Last week, HTML5 Customisation closet fixes were pushed.</strong> If you haven't checked yet, see if you can now load your wearables to customise your Neopet. If you still have issues, TNT has stated they're still looking into remaining issues.<br>
							<h6>Coming in a near-future release:</h6>
							<br>
							<blockquote>
								<ul>
									<li>The Festival of Neggs site theme will be hopping onto mobile-friendly pages soon.</li>
									<li>HTML5 maps</li>
									<li>Mobile-friendly faerie quests</li>
									<li>Mobile-friendly updates to the HTML5 wheels</li>
									<li>Community Central</li>
								</ul>
							</blockquote>
							<br><i>A member of TNT has also stated that if you're not a fan of the bright pink in this update's Valentine's Day theme, then sit tight... a sadder, greyer theme is also in the pipeline.</i>
							<h4>01.28 : inventory/ssw updates</h4>
							<b>A new update to the Neopets site redesign—v0.4.3—is now live! This update contains a handful of bug fixes:</b><br><br> 1) Quick Stock and item transfer links added to Inventory page A sweet and simple update. The top right corner of the inventory page now contains two icons that link the Quick Stock and item transfer pages:<br><br> 2) The Shop Wizard now contains a "Resubmit" button at the bottom to "refresh" the page. Now you can scroll to the bottom of the Shop Wizard results page to resubmit your search and get a new block of shops. Unfortunately, hitting the "Refresh" button in your browser does not actually refresh the results as you would expect.<br><img src="http://imgur.com/HvqVFrJ.gif" style="width: 90%; padding: 5%;"> Both the Shop Wizard and Super Shop Wizard can have searches submitted by tapping the "Enter" key on your keyboard.<br><br> 3) Multiple Neoboard Pens now react to the size of your device. Namely, before this update, if you had multiple Neoboard Pens, then they would fall off the side of the page on smaller devices (like smartphones) and prevent you from submitting a reply to a post.<br><br> The update also contains a number of other small fixes for site themes.<br><br> Coming in a near-future release:<br><br> A larger update with the following features will be released later this month:<br><br> HTML5 Premium Scratchcards<br> more converted Wheels<br> updates to the profile menu<br> a mobile-friendly "Winter Holiday" theme<br> and more!<br>
							<h4>12.27 : redesign updates and expectations</h4>
							<img src="https://imgur.com/FWRLMHh.gif" class="right" style="width:80px;padding: 2px; border: 2px solid white;"> A new update to the Neopets site redesign&mdash;v0.4.2&mdash;is now live! This update contains a number of changes:<br>
							<br>
							<strong>1) Classic pages for redesigned features no longer available.</strong> If a page has been converted to the new Neopets layout in the past several, months, the old Classic version of the page is no longer available. For example, the National Neopian Bank is available in the new layout, and at this time is no longer available to view using the Classic Neopets Layout. In practice, this means the "Return to Classic" option in the new layout's menu is no longer available. Any page that still has not been converted, such as the Trading Post, will continue to live on in the Classic view until its turn.<br>
							<br> We understand that this is may be a frustrating change for some. It's likely happening because it gets <em>very</em> difficult maintaining two versions of the same website (and we can empathize with TNT there). This change was bound to happen at some point, and it's likely happening now given that a sizable chunk of pages are now living under the new layout.<br>
							<br>
							<strong>2) Three of Neopia's wheels have been converted.</strong> The <a href="/faerieland/wheel.phtml">Wheel of Excitement</a>, <a href="/medieval/knowledge.phtml">Wheel of Knowledge</a>, and <a href="/prehistoric/mediocrity.phtml">Wheel of Mediocrity</a> have all been converted to be Flash-free, just ahead of the Flashpocalypse! This also means you can access and spin these wheels from your mobile devices.<br><br> The other three wheels&mdash;Monotony, Misfortune, and Extravagance&mdash;are promised to be following soon.<br>
							<br>
							<strong>3) The NC Mall "Try On" feature is now Flash-free.</strong> A simple change, clicking "Try On" in the NC Mall should now use the HTML5 version of the customisation app. At time of writing, however, it's not fully working for us.<br>
							<br>
							<strong>4) Classic pages for the Games Room and Customisation App remain.</strong> With the upcoming Flashpocalypse, these pages will not be useful for long, but if you can still run Flash, you can still access the Classic versions of Flash games and the Customisation Flash app.<br>
							<br>
							<center><a href="/games/classic.phtml" class="button">Classic Games Room &raquo;</a> <a href="/customise/classic.phtml" class="button">Classic Customisation &raquo;</a></center>
							<br>
							<strong>5) Score sending/NP rewards enabled for HTML5 games.</strong> Sending your score in the converted HTML5 games has been re-enabled. Score ratios will be adjusted as TNT looks at the data. (We're un-clear if there will still be a monthly score ratio update&mdash;stay tuned as we monitor.)<br>
							<br>
							<strong>6) The Pound doorways are Flash-free.</strong> The landing page for the <a href="/pound/">Neopian Pound</a> has also been updated to remove the Flash version of the three doors you click to get to Adopt, Transfer, or Abandon. A simple change that will be nice for the end of Flash.<br>
							<br> Coming in a near-future release:<br>
							<br>
							<blockquote>The Winter Holiday theme is coming next in a smaller content update in January. Create A Pet was going to be part of this release, but thanks to our changes to the rules recently, we decided to make some additional changes. The remaining wheels will also be coming ASAP, as well as a new Community Central hub page!</blockquote>
							<br> On a different note, with the forced retirement of Classic views for converted pages, one thing to be aware of is that Random Events currently <em>do not</em> work on the redesigned website. They simply have not been implemented yet. Since the forced change is live, we're hoping that TNT will consider porting over Random Events for the new site sooner, rather than later.<br>
							<br>
							<br><strong>Tired of the bright yellow site theme?</strong> Try changing your beta layout theme! There are multiple themes available right now:<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Neopets Basic</li>
								<li>Neopets Yellow</li>
								<li>Neopets Red</li>
								<li>Neopets Blue</li>
								<li>Neopets Green</li>
								<li>Neopets Purple</li>
								<li>Space Faerie Premium</li>
								<li>Altador Constellations (this one is nice and dark compared to "Basic")</li>
								<li>Haunted Woods</li>
								<li>Tis the Season</li>
							</ul> You may change it by clicking your Neopet in the top left corner of the site, then clicking on "Settings". (Or going directly to the <a href="/preferences.phtml">Settings page</a>.) Look for the "Beta Theme" dropdown menu and take your pick!<br>
							<br> Last heard from TNT, <em>all</em> site themes will be converted eventually. Next up, as seen above, is the Winter Holiday theme (unlockable via the Advent Calendar on December 31st if you've visited every day this year). <h4>12.24 : End of Flash TO-do List</h4>
							<img src="https://imgur.com/jHhZhfS.gif" class="right" style="width:80px;padding: 2px; border: 2px solid white;float:right;"> As you may be aware, Flash is officially ending its run on the web on January 12, 2021. This is a hard stop that Adobe, the makers of Flash, have hardcoded into the Flash Player software that you use in your web browser.<br>
							<br> Before January 12th arrives, we wanted to get together a list of "to-do's" involving features in Neopia that still rely on Flash. You may want to complete the items on this list before January 12th, or else there may be consequences until TNT releases a Flash-free version of said feature. For example, we recommend scratching your Premium scratchcards before January 12th, as that feature relies on Flash and it is unknown when TNT will implement an HTML5 version of Premium scratchcards.<br>
							<br> Here's what we recommend:<br>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Scratch all remaining <a href="/premium/sc/">Premium Scratchcards</a> you may have been awarded</li>
								<li>And likewise, scratch any <a href="/desert/sc/kiosk.phtml">Desert Scratchcards</a> you may wish to.</li>
								<li>Complete the <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/content/plot/index.php">Altador Mini-Plot</a> (the telescope portion uses Flash&mdash;if you already completed the plot, then you'll still be able to access the daily).</li>
								<li>Collect your worms in <a href="?go=tangorsworkshop">Moltara</a> (the Moltaran world maps are still Flash-based).</li>
								<li>Remove any furniture from inside or outside your <a href="/neohome/">Neohome 2.0</a>. (You can only remove an item from your Shed if it's not placed in your Neohome 2.0. Classic Neohomes can have items removed at any time, even without Flash working, so no issues there.)</li>
								<li>But speaking of Classic Neohomes, you should get the <a href="?go=avatars&s=classic+neohome">Robo</a> avatar if you don't have it already, as Classic Neohomes (and presumably the avatar for awhile) <em>will</em> be retiring. </li>
								<li>Use up any remaining <a href="http://ncmall.neopets.com/mall/shop.phtml?page=wonderclaw">Wonderclaw</a> and <a href="/mall/patapult/">Patapult</a> ticket packs you may have and wish to use before TNT revamps these features to be Flash-free.</li>
								<li>You may also want to use up any <a href="/halloween/nox_machine/">Corridor of Chance</a> keys you may have. The machine is Flash-free, but you do need to dress up your Neopet with items occupying specific zones in order to get the items you want, and that may be difficult until TNT converts all wearables to HTML5.</li>
								<li>Play a <a href="/games/">Flash-based game</a> to unlock any <a href="?go=avatars&id=games">secret avatars</a> before they become unavailable (until conversion). Or, play any of your favourites one final time before they are converted! (Visit the <a href="/halloween/gamegraveyard.phtml">Game Graveyard</a> to play a game that likely will not make it in the conversion.)</li>
								<li>Add <a href="/worlds/kiko/kpop/">Kiko Pop</a> to your dailies list for a shot at the avatar.</li>
								<li>Spin the <s>various Wheels of Neopia</s> Wheel of Misfortune, Extravagange, and/or Monotony to obtain each of their <a href="?go=avatars&s=wheel">secret avatars</a> you may still be missing. (As of 12/28/2020, the Wheels of Excitement, Mediocrity, and Knowledge are now Flash-free! TNT promises the remaining 3 wheels will come soon, so this to-do may not be that time sensitive.)</li>
							</ul>

							<br> We'd also like to take this time to get your questions! Anything worrying you about the Flash conversion? Ask away in the comments, and we can confirm whether Flash is needed or not. Something missing from our list above that other Neopians may want to use up before Flash dies? Let us know in the comments as well and we'll add it to the list! <h4>12.16 : Redesign Plans</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Before the end of 2020, the ability to switch between "Classic" and "Beta" will be removed. You will only be able to see the newly redesigned versions of pages (such as the homepage, Neopian Bank, etc.). Any pages not converted to the new design yet will remain in Classic.</li>
								<li>Games&mdash;even the converted ones&mdash;will have their Flash Classic versions remain available for the time being.</li>
								<li>More games will be converted to HTML5 in 2021. Some may be updated to be freshened up (think Destruct-O-Match II and III). Some, which are not played at all, will not be converted. Outside contractors are helping TNT here to speed up the process.</li>
								<li>Game score submissions will return in the final 2020 update.</li>
								<li>About 75% of wearables have been converted from Flash, and they're hoping to be close to 100% by the end of 2020. (Most are converted via an automatic script, but some are troublesome that need to be completely redone from scratch and fixed by hand by artists.)</li>
								<li>The Customisation app is slated for more updates and bug fixes in early 2021.</li>
								<li>Any world maps that haven't been converted yet (most of them still), will have quick links added underneath. "Hidden" links won't be included, like the Hidden Tower in Faerieland. You will need to find these on your own in the meantime. Converting the rest of the maps are still TBD.</li>
								<li>The Neopian Pound doors (adopt, disown, transfer) will be updated to be links instead of a Flash animation.</li>
								<li>Later on, the Neopian Pound will also receive QoL updates and a redesign.</li>
								<li>Any dailies based on Flash will be brought over throughout 2021.</li>
								<li>Some things may be retired, but for the most part everything will come back.</li>
								<li>Neohomes&mdash;both Classic and 2.0&mdash;will probably be retired, and come back instead as a completely new "Neohomes 3.0" version. All the existing furniture items are hoping to remain usable in whatever the new Neohomes look like.</li>
								<li>The focus is always on pages/features/things that users use the most day to day.</li>
								<li>They also want to balance adding in some new features and content. Including "possibly some new plots" in 2021. (Lutari Island was also name dropped.)</li>
								<li>A redesigned Trading Post is ready for development resources to tackle in an upcoming update.</li>

							<h4>flash end of life solutions</h4> The Flash software offered by Adobe that runs along-side your browser to allow for interactive web experiences such as Neopets games has now ended. Adobe announced the Adobe Flash EOL for January 12th 2021. You'll find that most of Internet will not sympathize with our concerns bc Flash has always been terrible, a security risk and they did allow a three-year grace period... but none the less, here we are wanting our site features back as soon as possible. Neopians are leaving by the day so we've listed a less than desirable but yet very easy work-around and other more recommended options below. Please be sure to do your own research and choose the option best suited for you. <br><br><b>Flash Free Games:</b> <i>http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=links</i>
							<h4>recommended solutions</h4>
							<b>update!</b> The previous work-arounds are no longer acceptable to use as the client will not be receiving any more updates to protect you while using flash. However a new chrome script has been introduced by the name of Ruffle of which will enable many site features such as: <i> Altador Mini-Plot Star Mapping, Double or Nothing Animation, Coconut Shy, Lair of the Beast Animation, Lost Desert Scratchcards, Apple Bobbing Animation, Lunar Temple , Tarla's Non-Toolbar Treasures Animation, Maps of Neopia, Kiss the Mortog Animation, Qasalan Expellibox, The Lutari Talisman, Test Your Strength, Grarrl Keno Animation, Turdle Racing, The Neopian Lottery Animation, Tutorial & NeoQuest 1 & 2 Animations (however games are not included) </i><br><br>
							<h6>More options</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>Download the Puffin Browser : It sucks, it's slow, and there are ads if you go with the free version (don't pay money for possible internet harm), but hey you can customize your UC pets and play Meerca Chase 2.</li>
								<li>Abode recommends using a solution from their Enterprise partner. This solution is a 'Chromium' browser bundled with electron.js and pepper api flash player and will cost you an annual license fee (and is limited to a single domain per license). -- The fact that this exists gives me hope for a permanent solution soon! (a free one...)<br><br> However, this is not the only solution for a less than desirable work-around or maybe one that's perfect for you! You can also inquire about emulators that will allow you to download and play flash content off-site (usually off-line as well) if you want to download your Neopets flash content to an archive - this is a great option for simply preserving flash content.</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>risky options</h4><i>Be aware of the risks that come with enabling Adobe Flash post-EOL as enabling outdated software could make your computer vulnerable to a variety of unwanted dangers such as security risks, malware, and more. It is NOT safe and we are NOT responsible for any dangers that may occur from enabling Adobe Flash post-EOL.</i><br><br>
							<strong>Enabling on Windows</strong><i> (Pale Moon, Waterfox)</i>
							<h6>Pale Moon :</h6>
							<ul>
								<li> Install Pale Moon</li>
								<li> Uninstall Flash if you already have any version installed.</li>
								<li> Download 32.0.0.XXX version of Flash.</li>
								<li> Disconnect your computer from the internet to install Flash.</li>
								<li> Set Flash to not automatically update.</li>
								<li> Restart (close/reopen) the browser and enjoy the site.</li>
							</ul>
							<h6>Waterfox</h6>
							<ul>
								<li> Install Waterfox </li>
								<li>Uninstall Flash if you already have any version installed. </li>
								<li>Download 32.0.0.XXX version of Flash. </li>
								<li>Disconnect your computer from the internet to install Flash. </li>
								<li>Set Flash to not automatically update. </li>
								<li>Restart (close/reopen) the browser and enjoy the site.</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Q&A</h4>
							<ul>
								<b>Q:</b> Is it safe to enable Flash post-EOL?<br>
								<b>A:</b> NO, IT IS NOT SAFE, but due to the popularity of running Flash post-EOL to run certain Neopets features (i.e. Flash Games and Customization), it's become a common request for people to take their chances with the danger.<br><br>
								<b>Q:</b> Is it against the rules to run Flash post-EOL to play Flash Games?<br>
								<b>A:</b> It is NOT recommended due to the safety risks, but you are allowed to run Flash post-EOL to play Neopets Flash Games assuming you're not cheating with the workaround (See Neopian Times, Issue 927).<br> Also, you are NOT allowed to submit scores for the same Flash Game and Beta Game within the same day (See Neopian Times, Issue 924).<br><br>
								<b>Q:</b> What is the best browser/method to run Flash with?<br>
								<b>A:</b> There is no best browser/method to run Flash with, they're all equally dangerous in their own way. As for safety, you'd want to either use a Virtual Machine or run a separate computer.<br><br>
								<b>Q:</b> Can I use X browser/method to enable Flash instead?<br>
								<b>A:</b> There are many browsers/methods you can run Flash on, but for the sake of brevity, we will be covering Pale Moon, Waterfox, and Puffin. Here is a list of alternative browsers/methods that have been successful with Neopians:<br> Virtual Machine (Works with Windows & Mac and is safer than all mentioned, but is storage heavy and complicated to comprehend/teach)<br> Basilisk Portable (Works with Windows)<br> Cent Browser (Works with Windows)<br> Firefox ESR (Works with Windows & Mac, but might not work with certain recommended versions and also don't use it if you use the regular Firefox browser often)<br> Puffin Desktop Browser (Works with Windows & Mac, but it costs money so nty glt)<br><br>
								<b>Q:</b> Should I use these browsers to browse other websites?<br>
								<b>A:</b> No. If you are going to enable Flash for Neopets, only use it for Neopets (not even for Neopets certified Fansites).<br><br>
								<b>Q:</b> Do I have to run Flash to finish the Altador Mini-Plot?<br>
								<b>A:</b> Fortunately, you do not, but you would have to download the Ruffle extension (don't worry it's safe to use and the instructions to download are provided on the page).

The streets and windows of shops are adorned bright colorful flowers for the spring festival. Among the floral scents, another bittersweet scent wafts pass your little nose, and you can't help but be drawn to it.
        The soft chime of a bell rings as you push in a red cafe door, and the aroma of coffee and pastries overtakes the flowers as the door gently swings back shut behind you.
        You see a tuft of a black bandanna behind the counter lined with sweets. "Welcome!" The barista's little head pops up underneath the bandanna. She smiles fondly at you when she sees you're sporting Roo Island merch you have indulge your wallet- I mean, yourself - in. "Ah, you must be another guest to the island! Feel free to sit anywhere you like."
        As you grab the nearest seat, you hear the humming of the expresso machine, followed by soft clinking of cups and plates, and the barista is already besides your table.
        "Coffee and cake are on the house for first time customers!" She says as she places down said items. "Enjoy! Let me know if you need anything else." She excuses herself to address the next set of customers flocking in.
        You look down at the dark roast presented to you and lift up the cup to take a sip. You gradually feel warm and fuzzy with how well the coffee and cake pairs so well together. You smile and look out the window at people walking along the streets, taking note to yourself to come back here again for your next visit to Roo Island.<br><br>Coffee Concessionaire</p></span></a>
